This directory contains a few lapack routines 
(see https://netlib.org/lapack/). 
Declared as device routines, they can be called by a single thread 
within the GPU. (Contributed by Xuejun Gong).
NB: zpotrf2.f90 has been substituted by a non recursive routine
(from wikipedia) since recursive device routines are still not available.
