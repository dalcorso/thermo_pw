Why we need to change these QE routines:


clocks_handler.f90 we increase the defaults number of clocks.
                   At line 45 maxclocks=2048

parameters.f90  we increase the maximum number of k points
                At line 16 npk=120000

lmdif.f90 we use at line 95 epsdiff=1.d-6 instead of zero.

rhoat_mod.f90 we need to call deallocate_tab_rhoat so we make this routine
              public at line 25

vloc_mod.f90 we deallocate tab_vloc only if it has been allocated.
             See at line 238.

uspp_data.f90 tab_at deallocated from the acc system only if allocated.

pwcom.f90 igk_k deallocated from the acc system only if allocated.

bfgs_module.f90  If the bfgs routine exceedes the maximum number of 
            allowed iterations there is no way to change the 
            bfgs_file in a different pw.x run. Added line 1121.

beta_mod.f90 we deallocate tab_beta only if it has been allocated.
             Moreover we need to use tab_beta so we made it PUBLIC.

io_dyn_mat.f90 The length of the atm vector became 6, but this routine was
             not changed
