Why we need to change these QE routines:

clocks_handler.f90 we increase the defaults number of clocks.
                   At line 45 maxclocks=2048

parameters.f90  we increase the maximum number of k points
                At line 16 npk=120000

lmdif.f90 we use at line 95 epsdiff=1.d-6 instead of zero.

rhoat_mod.f90 we need to call deallocate_tab_rhoat so we make this routine
              public at line 25

vloc_mod.f90 we deallocate tab_vloc only if it has been allocated.
             See at line 238.

uspp_data.f90 tab_at deallocated from the acc system only if allocated.

pwcom.f90 igk_k deallocated from the acc system only if allocated.
