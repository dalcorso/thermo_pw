# THERMO_PW QUICK HELP

<p align="justify"> 
To use <code>thermo_pw</code>, a functional version of the <a href="http://www.quantum-espresso.org/">Quantum ESPRESSO (QE)</a> package is required. <code>Thermo_pw</code> can be downloaded from its <a href="http://dalcorso.github.io/thermo_pw/">main page</a> as a <code>.tar.gz</code> file. The current production version is <code>2.0.2</code>, compatible with <code>QE-7.4</code>.</p>

<p align="justify"> 
Copy the <code>thermo_pw</code> archive into the main <code>QE</code> directory and unpack it using the command:</p>
<p align="center"> 
<code>tar -xzvf thermo_pw.2.0.2.tar.gz</code>
</p>
<p align="justify"> 
This command will create a directory named <code>thermo_pw</code>.
To compile the code, you will need a Fortran compiler (e.g., the <code>gcc</code> package with <code>gfortran</code>, or <code>gcc-fortran</code> in some distributions) and the same libraries required by <code>QE</code>.</p>

<p align="justify">
Once the <code>thermo_pw</code> directory is present in the main 
<code>QE</code> directory, cd into <code>thermo_pw</code> and write:</p>
<p align="center">
<code>make join_qe</code>
</p>
<p align="justify">
Then, cd back to the main <code>QE</code> directory and compile <code>thermo_pw</code> with the commands:</p>
<p align="center">
<code>./configure</code> </p>
<p align="center">
<code>make thermo_pw</code></p>

<p align="justify">
Alternatively, to use <code>cmake</code>, create a <code>build</code> directory, enter it, and execute:</p>
<p align="center">
<code>cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=c_compiler -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=fortran_compiler ../ </code><p>
<p align="justify">
or, to compile for GPU: </p>
<p align="center">
<code>cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=mpif90 -DQE_ENABLE_CUDA=ON -DQE_ENABLE_OPENACC=ON -DQE_ENABLE_MPI_GPU_AWARE=ON ../</code></p>

<p align="justify">
Subsequently, the <code>make</code> command will also generate the <code>thermo_pw.x</code> executable.</p>

<p align="justify">
For running <code>thermo_pw</code>, the <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">gnuplot</a> package is beneficial. To plot the Brillouin zone, the <a href="http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/">asymptote</a> package is necessary. Both are typically available as precompiled packages in many distributions.</p>

<p align="justify">
For further details, please consult the user guide located in the <code>thermo_pw/Doc</code> directory. Please report any issues to <a href="mailto:dalcorso .at. sissa.it">dalcorso.at.sissa.it</a>.</p>

**Development Version (Git):**
<p align="justify"> 
The development version of <code>thermo_pw</code> is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/dalcorso/thermo_pw">https://github.com/dalcorso/thermo_pw</a>. To download it, the git package is required. Then, you can run the command:</p>
<p align="center"> 
<code>git clone https://github.com/dalcorso/thermo_pw<code></p>

<p align="justify"> 
This will create a thermo_pw directory containing the source code.
Important Note: The Git version can only be used with <code>QE<code> version <code>7.4</code>. Be aware that the Git version may not always function correctly, and its use is generally not recommended.
Although thermo_pw has been in use for several years and is considered reasonably stable, it remains an experimental code provided "as is."</p>

**Compatibility with Older QE Versions:**

<p align="justify"> 
Older versions of <code>QE</code> (earlier than <code>7.4</code>) can still be used with <code>thermo_pw</code> by carefully matching the <code>thermo_pw</code> and <code>QE</code> versions, as detailed on the main <code>thermo_pw</code> page.</p>

<p align="justify"> Before using <code>thermo_pw</code>, please apply the

<br> 

**FAQ:**
<br><br>
1. How can I learn to use <code>thermo_pw</code>?
<br>
Please learn the basic use of <code>Quantum ESPRESSO</code> first. 
Then you can read the <code>thermo_pw</code> tutorial and user's guide and run 
the examples. These <code>FAQ</code> assume that you have a basic 
understanding of <code>thermo_pw</code> and contain miscellaneous information
not available in the user's guide.
<br><br>
2. Can I study the thermal expansion of anisotropic solids using <code>thermo_pw</code>?
<br>
For some crystal systems, yes, but not all systems are supported
or tested. Read carefully the user's guide and use a version higher than 
<code>0.3.0</code>. Also use dynamical matrices in <code>.xml</code> format 
or the calculation
of thermal expansion with Gruneisen parameters will not work with all 
versions previous to <code>0.5.0</code>.
<br><br>
3. Can I calculate the temperature dependence of the band gap or
in general of the band structure using <code>thermo_pw</code>?
<br>
You can calculate the band structure at the crystal geometry that corresponds
to a given temperature. In this way you evaluate the effect of thermal
expansion on the band structure or on the gap. However an important 
temperature dependence of the band gaps and of the band structure
comes from the electron-phonon interactions that are not included in 
<code>thermo_pw</code>. 
For this purpose you should use another package.
<br><br>
4. Can I calculate the equilibrium geometry of a solid at a given temperature using <code>thermo_pw</code>?
<br>
Yes, but the calculation is as heavy as computing the anharmonic properties
and it will take a lot of time and resources. You need to learn how to use 
<code>thermo_pw</code> before starting such a complex calculation.
<br><br>
5. Which is the difference between <code>examples</code> and <code>inputs</code>?
<br>
<code>Examples</code> illustrate the features of <code>thermo_pw</code> and are fast, but are not converged. <code>inputs</code> are more realistic examples.
<br><br>
6. Sometimes the examples of <code>thermo_pw</code> run correctly, sometimes they crash. Which is the problem?
<br>
The most probable reason is that you have not removed the <code>results</code> 
directory produced by a previous run of the example script.
<br><br>
7. <code>make thermo_pw</code> is not working. Compilation stops with some missing routines error. 
<br>
Most probably you have not matched the versions of <code>QE</code> and of <code>thermo_pw</code>.
<br><br>
8. I have compiled <code>thermo_pw</code> but as I run it, it stops immediately.
I am using <code>thermo_pw.0.3.0</code>.
<br>
Most probably you have not applied the patch described above. Update to a
newer version.
<br><br>
9. After unpacking the tar file there is no <code>thermo_pw</code> directory.
<br>
The directory obtained unpacking the source files obtained from the github 
releases web page is called <code>thermo_pw-#version number</code>. Just 
change the name of this directory to <code>thermo_pw</code>.
<br><br>
10. I cannot run the examples. I have problems using images. What 
should I do?
<br>
If you want to run the examples without images 
edit the file <code>environment_variables</code> in the main <code>QE</code>
directory. Search the two variables <code>PARA_IMAGE_PREFIX</code> and
<code>PARA_IMAGE_POSTFIX</code> and set <code>-ni 1</code>. 
<br><br>
11. I have not a parallel computer. I do not know what <code>mpi</code> is. 
Can I run <code>thermo_pw</code>?
<br>
Only <code>thermo_pw.0.5.0</code> or later versions can be compiled in serial. All previous versions must be compiled together with <code>mpi</code>.
<br><br>
12. An ionic relaxation converges with <code>pw.x</code> but not with <code>thermo_pw.x</code> (version <code>0.4.0</code>).
<br>
This is a bug of version <code>0.4.0</code>. Please  
update to a newer version.
<br><br>
13. The plot of the phonon dispersions is very strange with several disjoint
parts. Moreover the modes are not classified using symmetry. Why?
<br>
The mode symmetry analysis requires dynamical matrices in <code>.xml</code> 
format. Please put the  <code>.xml</code> extension in the <code>fildyn</code>
variable in the <code>ph.x</code> input.
Symmetry matrices are needed also to recognize symmetry equivalent point
on the Brillouin zone.
<br><br>
14. The plot of the Gruneisen parameters has strange crossings in some points.
Why?
<br>
In some cases the plot of the Gruneisen parameters needs more accuracy 
on the symmetry analysis than the phonon plot. Accidentally degenerate 
frequencies might have very different Gruneisen parameters. Change the 
parameter <code>5.D-2</code> at line 148 of 
<code>PHonon/PH/find_mode_sym.f90</code> to <code>1.D-2</code> or 
less and recompile <code>thermo_pw</code>.
<br><br>
15. Thermo_pw documentation does not compile and stops with an error 
saying that
<code>html.sty</code> is missing or <code>latex2html</code> is missing.
<br>
This is not a problem of <code>thermo_pw</code>. In order to compile the
documentation <code>thermo_pw</code> needs a quite complete 
<code>latex</code> package. You can find <code>html.sty</code> on
the web and copy it inside <code>thermo_pw/Doc</code> directory and you
can install the package <code>latex2html</code>. Even if you do not solve this problem, 
<code>thermo_pw.x</code> will be available in the <code>bin</code> directory 
of QE. Only the documentation will be missing. 
<br><br>
16. The plot of the projected band structure has some problems. Some gaps
have the same color of the projected band structure. 
<br>
This is a problem of old versions of gnuplot. Update to gnuplot 5.0 or higher.
<br><br>
17. The phonon dispersion plot seems strange, some branches are missing.
<br>
Please check that you used enough digits for the atomic positions. A typical
problem appears when you write 1/3 and 2/3 in single precision. The 
<code>pw.x</code> code finds more symmetries than those that are
actually present in the final modes and the routine that identifies the 
mode symmetry gets 
confused.
<br><br>
18. The code fails to identify the space group and stops with an error
''point group orientation incorrect''.
<br>
Most probably you are simulating a noncollinear magnetic system. Magnetic
space group identification is not implemented but no check is done in versions
up to 0.9.0. Please make the same changes as commit a68e6cb of 18 January 2018.
If you find this error, you are using ibrav/=0, and your system is collinear,
please send me your input.

19. <code>what='scf_disp'</code> and partial phonon computations with
<code>start_q</code>, <code>last_q</code> or <code>start_irr</code> 
<code>last_irr</code> gives strange error messages.
<br>
The option <code>what='scf_disp'</code> requires all the dynamical matrices
files in the <code>dynamical_matrices</code> directory. Use 
<code>what='scf_ph'</code> until you collect all the dynamical matrices
and do a final run with <code>what='scf_disp'</code>.
<br><br>
20. I am computing a phonon dispersion but some <B>q</B> points are not 
computed.
<br>
Most probably you have not cleaned the <code>outdir</code> directory. Note that the 
<code>thermo_pw</code> always tries to use the content of the 
<code>outdir</code> directory if present.
<br><br>
21. Is it possible to increase the temperature range? 
<br>
Yes, you have to remove the <code>therm_files</code> directory
while keeping the <code>dynamical_matrices</code> and the 
<code>restart</code> directories. If you removed the <code>outdir</code> 
directory, use <code>after_disp=.TRUE.</code> and set <code>fildyn</code> 
with the name of the dynamical matrices.
<br><br>
22. Is it possible to increase the number of points used to compute the
phonon dos?
<br>
Yes, you have to remove both the <code>phdisp_files</code> and the
<code>therm_files</code> directories
while keeping the <code>dynamical_matrices</code> and the 
<code>restart</code> directories. 
<br><br>
23. I made a calculation with <code>with_eigen=.FALSE.</code>. Is it possible
to restart with <code>with_eigen=.TRUE.</code>?
<br>
Yes, but you have to remove both the <code>phdisp_files</code> and the 
<code>therm_files</code> directories, while keeping the 
<code>dynamical_matrices</code> and the <code>restart</code> directories.
<br><br>
24. I am using <code>thermo_pw 1.3.1</code> with<code>QE6.6</code> but 
the code hangs or stops in random places when computing phonon dispersions. 
<br>
Be careful with the use of pools. Since version <code>6.6 QE</code> 
does not stop any longer if some pools have no k points, but 
<code>thermo_pw</code> cannot deal with 
this case. In order to check if you are in this situation search the
string 'suboptimal parallelization: some nodes have no k-points' in your
output. The solution is to decrease the number of pools until the
message disappear.
If you want a permanent check of this problem use <code>thermo_pw.1.3.2</code>.
<br><br>
25. <code>tmp_dir</code> cannot be opened.
<br>
Check your <code>outdir</code> directory in the <code>pw.x</code> input.
Usually this error indicates a missing parent directory. You might have
an error in the path indicated in <code>outdir</code> or
you are not allowed to write or execute the parent directory.
<br><br>
26. Error in namelist.
<br>
Most probably there is a mistake in a variable of the namelist. Please
check accurately the user guide. The other possibility is that your
editor added some hidden characters in the input file. Please check
for it for instance with the command <code>cat -A input_file</code>.
Another possibility is that you are reading the user guide of a version
of <code>thermo_pw</code> different from the one you are using and the
variable is not yet available. Please match the versions of the user guide
and of <code>thermo_pw</code>.
<br><br>
27. Point group incompatible with the Bravais lattice.
<br>
This means that your point group is different from the point groups compatible
with a given Bravais lattice. The calculation is still possible but
<code>thermo_pw</code> will not be able to find the space group and 
will not use the symmetries to simplify the calculation of the physical 
properties. Please check if you can find why some symmetries are missing,
or why you have too many symmetries. Try to use one of the Bravais
lattices suggested by the code. The message might also indicate that
you have a supercell. If this is what you want, just ignore the message and
continue the calculation, otherwise simplify your cell.
<br><br>
28. Is <code>thermo_pw</code> compatible with the GPU version of QE?
<br>
In part it is. With QE6.7 and with version 1.5.0 
you can give the command <code>make tpw_gpu</code>
to obtain a version of the code that can be compiled with 
<code>q-e-gpu.6.7</code>. Version 1.5.1 and QE6.8 or later versions
can be compiled with CUDA enabled with the same commands used to
enable CUDA in QE. You need to run configure with the CUDA options.
Version 1.9.0 has been tested on Leonardo at CINECA with the nvidia
fortran compiler. 
<br><br>
29. The band or phonon symmetry is not indicated. There are many
question marks instead of the names of the irreducible representations.
<br>
The question marks indicate that the algorithm that finds the symmetry is
confused and is unable to find a well defined symmetry. There are several 
possible reasons: 
* You might have a too small cut-off, or
a too large threshold for the self consistence and the symmetry is not
accurate enough. Please modify these parameters.
* Your atomic positions are quite close to a symmetry position but
not exactly there. This is a common problem when using single precision
atomic coordinates. Please correct the atomic coordinates adding more digits. 
* There might be some problem with the pseudopotential and
there is some ghost state. Please check other pseudopotentials to
see if the problem disappears. 
* If none of the above applies, there might be a problem in the algorithm 
that finds the symmetry. Please send me your input or post it to one of
the forum mailing lists.
<br><br>
30. Can I compute the temperature dependent elastic constants with 
<code>thermo_pw</code>?
* Quasi-static elastic constants are available from version <code>0.6.0</code>.Quasi-harmonic elastic constants require version <code>1.2.0</code> or
later. The electronic contribution is implemented only starting for
version <code>1.4.0</code>. 
* Note that this feature is still work in progress and there are still 
some limitations. For instance, atomic coordinates are relaxed only at 
zero temperature.
* Note also that the quasi-harmonic calculation is very time consuming.
As an order of magnitude it requires hundreds of phonon dispersion 
calculations.
<br><br>
31. Laue class not available when computing elastic constants.
* This error usually means that your system has less symmetry than 
expected from the Bravais lattice. For instance there is no Laue class 
available for a solid with a cubic Bravais lattice and point group symmetry 
different from T, T_d, T_h, O, or O_h.
* In this case the <code>thermo_pw</code> output writes that the point 
group and the Bravais lattice are not compatible and gives a set of 
Bravais lattices compatible with the symmetry. If you think that the 
symmetry of your system is correct, then you should use one of the 
Bravais lattices suggested by <code>thermo_pw</code>. Instead if some 
symmetry is missing for other reasons (see the Quantum Espresso PW 
user's guide for possible reasons), 
then correct the problem before running the elastic constant calculation.
* If you are using supercells or you have a low dimensional system in a 
supercell, then probably thermo_pw is not yet suited to compute automatically
the elastic constants of your system.
<br><br>
32. <code>Thermo_pw</code> does not compile (with Quantum ESPRESSO version 7.0 or later). There is an error no rule to make file <code>make.depend</code>.
* After writing <code>make join_qe</code> and returning to QE root directory
you need to rerun <code>./configure</code> before <code>make thermo_pw</code>.
(Thanks to H. Zhao for reporting the problem).
33. <code>Thermo_pw</code> has problems with fully relativistic PAW. 
* Before reporting such problems check the correct matching of the 
PP_AEWFC_REL tag in the UPF file and in the upf reading routine. 
Starting from version 6.5 of QE and until version 6.7 the xml tag for 
the small component of the all electron partial waves has been called 
PP_AEWFC_rel, while in previous versions of QE it was called PP_AEWFC_REL. 
As such the fully relativistic
pseudopotentials created with a version of QE older than 6.5 (as many of 
the PPs distributed in the QE site) were no more read correctly. The code
does not stop and most of the time produces only slightly uncorrect results 
expecially in the PP test. To read a PP that contains the 
PP_AEWFC_REL tag you can change the file upflib/read_upf_new.f90 and 
upflib/write_upf_new.f90 searching
for the string PP_AEWFC_rel in both files and changing it into PP_AEWFC_REL.
In QE6.8, QE7.0, and QE7.1 the routine upflib/read_upf_new.f90 
has been corrected and these versions of QE read correctly UPF PPs with the tag
PP_AEWFC_REL, but unfortunately continue to write UPF PP with the tag 
PP_AEWFC_rel. The routine upflib/write_upf_new.f90 must be changed to 
make the code consistent and to read correctly the pseudopotential generated
by the same version of QE. For version QE7.0 apply also the correction to
PW/src/v_of_rho.f90 described above.
