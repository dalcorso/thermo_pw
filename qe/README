This directory contains routines of Quantum ESPRESSO that need to be modified 
to be used in thermo_pw and new routines that add new capabilities to
QE. The name of the files with the QE routines remain unchanged but the 
actual routine inside the file has the _tpw extension.

Presently they are:

electrons_tpw: contains a call to asyn_master to have the master check for
               slaves that need further work at each electron iteration.

find_band_sym_tpw : call rotate_all_psi_tpw.

rotate_all_psi_tpw : an improved version of rotate_all_psi that 
               requires less memory and scale better with the CPUs.
               It works both for spinor and scalar wavefunctions.

setup_tpw : limits the minimum value of ethr to 10^-13 in a band canculation.
            Sometimes the bands do not converge because this value becomes 
            too small.

solve_linter_tpw: contains a call to asyn_master to have the master check for
            slaves that need further work at each phonon iteration.

phqscf_tpw : call solve_linter_tpw instead of solve_linter. Uses the new
            logic of the effective charges. Call do_cg_ph if lcg is .TRUE..

prepare_q_tpw: use the variable tcollect_all to avoid the calculation of
            the bands in the final run that collects all the dynamical 
            matrices.

run_nscf_tpw : call set_small_group_q also in the lgamma_iq case.
            Set lscf to .false. because thermo_pw reads the input of pw 
            that sets lscf or can do a scf calculation that sets this variable.

non_scf_tpw : call c_bands_nscf_tpw

c_bands_nscf_tpw : call asyn_master so that during the band calculation the
            master can assign tasks to the slaves.
            Some wavefunctions can be computed by applying a symmetry
            operator when sym_for_diago is .TRUE.

do_phonon_tpw : call phqscf_tpw instead of phqscf and prepare_q_tpw instead
            of prepare_q. Now moved to the ../src directory.

irrek_tpw : Check if a k point can be obtained by another using symmetry.
            This routine sets the three arrays diago_bands, isym_band, 
            ik_origin.

set_kplusq_tpw : adds also the information on the symmetry and original k. Also
            for k+q. 

phescf_tpw : call the more general routine solve_e_fpolc in the case of finite
            frequency instead of solve_e_fpol.
            Call the lanczos routines when llanczos=.TRUE..
            In the static case calls the routine do_cg_e when lcg=.TRUE..
            Uses the new logics for computing the effective charges.  

ccg_psi_tpw : uses the new conventions for the noncollinear case.

phq_summary_tpw : summarize the frequencies in complex form

initialize_ph_tpw : calls the new routine phq_summary_tpw, phq_init_tpw
            and allocate_phq_tpw

adddvepsi_us_tpw : added the number of occupated bands as an input.

ev_xml_tpw : is identical to the QE routine, but it is copied here 
            because files in the PW/tools directory are not linked to thermo_pw.

read_dyn_from_file_tpw : in the routine of PH there is an implicit dependence
            on first. Since thermo_pw calls this routine for several
            geometries, the first file of each geometry should be considered as
            first. Removed the dependence on first.

drho_tpw : must call compute_drhous_tpw and compute_drhous_nc_tpw
            instead of compute_drho_us and compute_drhous_nc.

mix_pot_tpw : it is derived from that of QE, but does not reset the
            history. Seems better for optical properties. 

phq_init_tpw : call drho_tpw instead of drho and call add_zstar_us_tpw
            which computes the part of the effective charges independent
            on the response.

phq_readin_tpw : reads all the additional variables of the phonon, 
            such as the real part of the frequency, llanczos and the
            variables that control the option, lcg etc.

collect_grid_files_tpw : uses the fact that the images can divide the 
            collection work.

check_initial_status_tpw : calls some of the tpw routines and call the ph image
            generator if with_ph_images=.TRUE.

kpoint_grid_tpw : is parallelized among the processors

q_points_tpw : only the meta_ionode writes the q points in the dynamical
            matrix file (better scaling with images).

realspace_grid_init_tpw : It became a private routine in QE so we copied it 
            here to use in thermo_pw.

ruotaijk_tpw : receives the ss matrices instead of s.

print_symmetries_tpw : output slightly improved. Writes the Cayley-Klein 
            parameters for each symmetry.

find_mode_sym_tpw : similar to the one of QE but does not need a threshold to
            choose the degenerate modes.
