This directory contains few routines of Quantum ESPRESSO that need to
be modified to be used in thermo_pw.

Presently they are:

electrons_tpw: contains a call to asyn_master to have the master check for
                 slaves that need further work at each electron iteration.

solve_linter_tpw: contains a call to asyn_master to have the master check for
                 slaves that need further work at each phonon iteration.

phqscf_tpw : call solve_linter_tpw instead of solve_linter. Uses the new
             logic of the effective charges.

prepare_q_tpw: use the variable tcollect_all to avoid the calculation of
         the bands in the final run that collects all the dynamical matrices.

run_nscf_tpw : call set_small_group_q also in the lgamma_iq case. This change
               can probably be done also in the phonon, but it is tested here
               before changing qe. Set lscf to .false. because thermo_pw
               reads the input of pw that sets lscf or can do a scf calculation
               that sets this variable.

do_phonon_tpw : call phqscf_tpw instead of phqscf and prepare_q_tpw instead
            of prepare_q. Now moved to the ../src directory.

phescf_tpw : call the more general routine solve_e_fpolc in the case of finite
             frequency instead of solve_e_fpol.

ccg_psi_tpw : uses the new conventions for the noncollinear case.

phq_summary_tpw : summarize the frequencies in complex form

initialize_ph_tpw.f90 : calls the new routine phq_summary_tpw, phq_init_tpw
                 and allocate_phq_tpw

adddvepsi_us_tpw.f90 : added the number of occupated bands as an input.

ev_xml : is identical to the QE routine, but it is copied here because files
         in the PW/tools directory are not linked to thermo_pw.

read_dyn_from_file : in the routine of PH there is an implicit dependence
         on first. The routine makes two different things if it is called
         for the first time. Since thermo_pw calls this routine for several
         geometry, the first file of each geometry should be considered as
         first. Removed the dependence on first.

usnldiagq.f90 generalizes usnldiag.f90. It computes the diagonal elements 
              of the Hamiltonian at k+q (except the kinetic energy).

drho_tpw.f90 must call compute_drhous_tpw and compute_drhous_nc_tpw
             instead of compute_drho_us and compute_drhous_nc.

mix_pot_tpw.f90 it is derived from that of QE, but does not reset the
            history. Seems better for optical properties. 

phq_init_tpw.f90 call drho_tpw instead of drho and call add_zstar_us_tpw
            which computes the part of the effective charges independent
            on the response.

phq_readin_tpw.f90 reads all the additional variables of the phonon, 
            such as the real part of the frequency.


This directory contains also some routines that are new, or generalize
those of QE. They are still experimental.

solve_e_fpolc.f90 : equivalent of solve_e, but computes the +w and -w
                    frequencies. Used to compute the complex
                    macroscopic dielectric constant at finite frequency.
