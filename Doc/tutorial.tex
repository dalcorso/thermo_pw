\section{\color{coral}Introduction}

This guide gives a brief overview of the \thermo\ package. 
It gives you the minimal information needed to accomplish a given task.
It assumes that you have already downloaded and compiled \qe\ and \thermo\  
and you want to calculate some material property but you do not known where 
to start. 
The ultimate reference for the use of \thermo\ is its user's guide,
however the capabilities of the code are rapidly expanding and the 
user's guide is becoming long, so if you do not want
to read it entirely you can find here where the relevant information are.
There might be some limitations on the type of functionals that you can use 
or the electronic structure scheme available to compute a given quantity.
Please refer to the \qe\ documentation for this.

\section{\color{coral}People}
This tutorial has been written by Andrea Dal Corso (SISSA - Trieste). 

\section{\color{coral}Overview}

In order to make a calculation with \thermo\ you need to be able to 
produce an input file for the \texttt{pw.x} code of \qe. This input file
requires mainly five information:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Bravais lattice.

\item The position of the atoms inside the unit cell.

\item The type of atoms and the pseudopotentials files that you want to use.

\item The cut-off energies.

\item The {\bf k}-point mesh used to make integrations over
the Brillouin zone. The smearing parameter for metals. 
\end{itemize}

The Bravais lattice is specified by an integer number \texttt{ibrav} and by the
crystal parameters \texttt{celldm} (up to six numbers). You can find 
information on the \texttt{ibrav} code and on the required crystal parameters
in the file \texttt{PW/Doc/INPUT\_PW} of the \qe\ distribution. 
In \qe\ you can use \texttt{ibrav=0} and give the primitive
lattice vectors of the Bravais lattice. Presently \thermo\ needs to
known the Bravais lattice number so this form of input is not recommended. 
If you use it, \thermo\ writes on output the \texttt{ibrav}, the 
\texttt{celldm} and the atomic coordinates needed to simulate
the same cell and stops.
You can therefore just cut and paste \texttt{ibrav}, \texttt{celldm} 
and the atomic coordinates in the input of \texttt{pw.x}. Alternatively
you can set the flag \texttt{find\_ibrav=.TRUE.} in the \thermo\ input
and \thermo\ will make the conversion for you and run the job. 
After setting the correct
\texttt{ibrav} and \texttt{celldm}, \texttt{thermo\_pw} might still tell you
that the Bravais lattice is not compatible with the point group. This
can happen, for instance, if you have isolated molecules, amorphous solids,
defects, or supercells. In these cases you can still continue but symmetry 
will not be 
used to reduce the number of components of the physical quantities tensors. 
In order to use the residual symmetry, you have to
use one of the suggested \texttt{ibrav}, adjusting the \texttt{celldm} to
the parameters of your cell. For instance if you have a cubic cell, but
the symmetry requires a tetragonal lattice, you have to use a tetragonal
lattice with \texttt{celldm(3)=1.0}.
In rare cases, with lattices such as the face-centered orthorhombic some
symmetry operations might be incompatible with the FFT grid found by 
\texttt{pw.x}. The choice made in \qe\ is to discard these symmetries making
the lattice incompatible with the point group. In these cases the code needs 
\texttt{nr1=nr2=nr3}. Set these three parameters in the \texttt{pw.x} input 
equal to the largest one. 

The positions of the atoms inside the unit cell are defined by an integer
number \texttt{nat} (the number of atoms) and by \texttt{nat} 
three-dimensional vectors as explained in the file \texttt{PW/Doc/INPUT\_PW}.
You can use several units, give the coordinates in the Cartesian or in the
crystal basis or you can give the space group number and the
coordinates of the nonequivalent atoms. 
These options are supported by \thermo. See the \texttt{pw.x} manual
for details. \\

The number of different types of atoms is given by an integer number 
\texttt{ntyp} and for each atomic type you need to specify a 
pseudopotential file. Pseudopotential files depend on the exchange and 
correlation functional and can be found in many 
different places. There is a pseudopotential page in the \qe\ website, or 
you can consider generating your pseudopotentials with the \texttt{pslibrary} 
inputs. You can consult the web page \texttt{https://dalcorso.github.io/pslibrary/} for more information. \\

The kinetic energies cut-offs depend on the pseudopotentials
and on the accuracy of your calculation. You can 
find some hints about the required cut-offs inside the pseudopotentials files,
but you need to check the convergence of your results with the cut-off 
energies. Many tests of the kinetic energy cut-offs can be found also at 
\texttt{https://www.materialscloud.org/discover/sssp/}. \\

The {\bf k}-point mesh is given by three integer numbers and possible
shifts (0 or 1) in the three directions. The convergence of the results
with this mesh should be tested. For metals you have also to specify a
smearing method (for instance \texttt{occupations='smearing'}, 
\texttt{smearing='mp'}) and a value of the smearing parameter (in Ry) 
(see the variable \texttt{degauss} in the file \texttt{PW/Doc/INPUT\_PW}). 
Note that the convergence with respect to the {\bf k}-points depends on
the value of \texttt{degauss} and must be tested for each \texttt{degauss}. \\

Once you have an input for \texttt{pw.x}, in order to run \thermo\ you
have to write a file called \texttt{thermo\_control} that contains a
namelist called \texttt{INPUT\_THERMO}. This namelist contains a keyword
\texttt{what} that controls the calculation performed by 
\thermo. Ideally you need to set only \texttt{what} and call 
\texttt{thermo\_pw.x} instead of \texttt{pw.x}, giving as input the 
input prepared for \texttt{pw.x}.

\section{\color{coral}How do I make a self-consistent calculation?}
Use \texttt{what='scf'}. See \texttt{example01}. The calculation is
equivalent to a call to \texttt{pw.x} and is controlled by
its input. In particular in the input of \texttt{pw.x} you can choose
a single self-consistent calculation using \texttt{calculation='scf'}, 
an atomic relaxation using \texttt{calculation='relax'}, or a cell relaxation 
using \texttt{calculation='vc-relax'}.
The use of \texttt{calculation='nscf'} and \texttt{calculation}
\texttt{='bands'} is
not supported by \thermo\ and could give unpredictable results.
There is no advantage to use \thermo\ to do a molecular dynamic
calculation. 

\section{\color{coral}How do I plot the band structure?}
Use \texttt{what='scf\_bands'}. See \texttt{example02}.
With this option \thermo\ calls twice
\texttt{pw.x} making first a self-consistent calculation with the parameters
given in the \texttt{pw.x} input and then a band calculation along a 
path chosen by \thermo, or along a path given by the user
after the \texttt{INPUT\_THERMO} namelist. The path can be given as
in the \texttt{pw.x} input, but see the user's guide for additional details.
There are a few parameters that you can give in the \texttt{INPUT\_THERMO} namelist to control the band plot. The most useful are 
\texttt{emin\_input} and \texttt{emax\_input} that allow you to plot the 
bands in a given energy range. At the end of the run, the figure of the bands is
in a file called \texttt{output\_band.ps}, if you do not change the name 
of the postscript file in the \thermo\ input.
Check also the option \texttt{what='scf\_2d\_bands'} if you need
to plot the surface band structure.

\section{\color{coral}How do I plot of the electronic density of states?}
Use \texttt{what='scf\_dos'}. See \texttt{example18}. With this option
\thermo\ calls twice \texttt{pw.x} making first a self-consistent calculation
followed by a non self-consistent calculation on a uniform {\bf k}-point mesh.
This mesh can be specified in the \thermo\ input (if none is given \thermo\ 
uses the default values). At the end of the run, the figure of the density of
states is in a file called \texttt{output\_eldos.ps} if you do not
specify the name of the postscript file in the \thermo\ input.

\section{\color{coral}How can I see the crystal structure?}
\thermo\ is not a crystal structure viewer, but you can use the code 
\texttt{XCrySDen} that reads the \texttt{pw.x} input to
see the crystal structure. If you use \texttt{what='plot\_bz'}, 
\thermo\ produces a \texttt{.xsf} file that contains the structure given in
input and can be read directly by \texttt{XCrySDen}. This could
be useful when you give the space group number and the nonequivalents 
atomic positions since this input is presently not readable by 
\texttt{XCrySDen}.
The generated \texttt{.xsf} file contains all the symmetry equivalent 
atomic positions. For the same purpose you could also use the output
of \texttt{pw.x}.

\section{\color{coral}How can I see the Brillouin zone?}
Use \texttt{what='plot\_bz'}. See \texttt{example12}. With this option
\thermo\ does not call \texttt{pw.x}, it just produces a script for
the \texttt{asymptote} code with the instructions to plot the Brillouin
zone and the standard path (or the path that you have given in the \thermo\ 
input).

\section{\color{coral}How can I plot the X-ray powder diffraction spectrum?}
Use \texttt{what='plot\_bz'} to see the spectrum corresponding to
the geometry given in the \texttt{pw.x} input. You can also see the
spectrum corresponding to a relaxed structure using for instance
\texttt{what='scf'}, asking for an atomic (cell) relaxation in the \texttt{pw.x}
input and using \texttt{lxrdp=.TRUE.} variable in the \thermo\ input.
The X-ray powder diffraction spectrum is shown in a file called 
\texttt{output\_xrdp.ps}, if the name of the postscript file is not
given in the \thermo\ input. The scattering angles and intensities
are also written in a file called \texttt{output\_xrdp.dat}, if the filename
is not given in the \thermo\ input.

\section{\color{coral}How can I find the space group of my crystal?}
Use \texttt{what='plot\_bz'} and look at the output. The space group is
identified. In the case you have a structure with \texttt{ibrav=0} and
the primitive lattice vectors use the option \texttt{find\_ibrav=.TRUE.} 
in the \texttt{thermo\_pw} input (see the \texttt{thermo\_pw} user's guide 
in the subsection
{\it Coordinates and structure}). This option has presently some limitations.
It does not work for noncollinear magnetic system, or for supercells, or
when the Bravais lattice and the point group are incompatible.

\section{\color{coral}How do I plot the phonon dispersions?}
Use \texttt{what='scf\_disp'}. See \texttt{example04}. In this case you
have to prepare an input for the \texttt{ph.x} code that must be
called \texttt{ph\_control}. The required information in this input
is the {\bf q}-point mesh on which the dynamical matrices are computed
and the name of the files where the dynamical matrices are written.
See the \texttt{ph.x} guide if you need information on this point.
At the end of the run, the phonon dispersions are found in a file 
called \texttt{output\_disp.ps.g1},
if the name of the postscript file is not given in the \thermo\ input.
The vibrational density of states is found in a file called 
\texttt{output\_dos.ps.g1}, if the name of the postscript file in not
given in the \thermo\ input.

\section{\color{coral}How do I calculate the vibrational energy, free energy, entropy, and heat capacity?}
Use \texttt{what='scf\_disp'}. See \texttt{example04}. These quantities
are calculated after the phonon dispersion calculation for the default 
temperature range ($1$ K - $800$ K) or for the range
given in the \thermo\ input. The figure of these quantities is in the file 
\texttt{output\_therm.ps.g1}.
Note that they are calculated at the geometry given in the input
of \texttt{pw.x}.


\section{\color{coral}How do I calculate the elastic constants?}
Use \texttt{what='scf\_elastic\_constants'}. See \texttt{example13}. The
elastic constants appear in the output of \thermo\ and also in a file
called \texttt{output\_el\_cons.dat}, if the name of the file is not
given in input. This file can be read by \thermo\ for the options
that require the knowledge of the elastic constants.

\section{\color{coral}How do I calculate the Debye temperature?}
Use \texttt{what='scf\_elastic\_constants'}. See \texttt{example13}. The
Debye temperature appears in the output of \thermo. A file called
\texttt{output\_therm.ps\_debye} contains plots of the vibrational
energy, free energy, entropy, and heat capacity computed within the 
Debye model.

\section{\color{coral}How do I calculate the equilibrium structure?}
Use \texttt{what='mur\_lc'}. See \texttt{example05}. Refer to the user's
guide for anisotropic solids. The crystal
parameters are written in the \thermo\ output file. Note that the structure is
searched interpolating with a polynomial or with the Murnaghan
equation the energy calculated for several geometries close to the geometry 
given in the input of \texttt{pw.x} so the closer this structure is to the 
actual equilibrium structure the better the fit is and the
closer the value found by \thermo\ to the real minimum. If the 
equilibrium structure is very different from the one given in the 
\texttt{pw.x} input you might want to repeat the calculation starting 
from the new equilibrium structure. You can also check with the file
\texttt{output\_mur.ps} (when \texttt{lmur=.true.}) or 
\texttt{output\_energy.ps} (when \texttt{lmur=.false.}) if the minimum
found is within the range of calculated structures. If this is not 
the case the minimum has probably a non negligible error.
Note also that almost all options can be specified using
\texttt{what='mur\_lc\_...'} instead of \texttt{what='scf\_...'}.
In this case they are calculated at the equilibrium geometry instead of
the geometry given in the \texttt{pw.x} input. 
This holds also if a finite pressure is specified in the \thermo\ input 
and the equilibrium structure corresponds to the given pressure (See below).

\section{\color{coral}How do I calculate the equilibrium structure 
at a given pressure?}
Use \texttt{what='mur\_lc'} and specify \texttt{pressure=value} in kbar in the
\thermo\ input. Note that in the input of \texttt{pw.x} you should 
give a geometry which is as close as possible to the equilibrium value
found by the code at the given pressure (see above).

\section{\color{coral} How do I specify the temperature range} 
See the \texttt{thermo\_pw} user's guide in the subsection 
{\it Temperature and Pressure}.

\section{\color{coral} How do I calculate the crystal parameters as a function
of temperature?}
Use \texttt{what='mur\_lc\_t'}. See \texttt{example09}. Note that
for this option you need to give also the \texttt{ph.x} input.
For anisotropic solids you need to specify \texttt{lmurn=.FALSE.},
otherwise you calculate only the volume as a function of temperature
varying \texttt{celldm(1)} but keeping all the other crystal parameters
constant. The crystal parameters are plotted as a function of temperature
in the standard temperature range if not given in input, in the file 
\texttt{output\_anharm.ps} for cubic solids and
\texttt{output\_anharm.ps\_celldm} for anisotropic
solids if the name of the postscript file is not given in input.

\section{\color{coral} How do I calculate the thermal expansion?}
Use \texttt{what='mur\_lc\_t'}. See \texttt{example09}. The thermal expansions
are shown as a function of temperature in the file \texttt{output\_anharm.ps}.

\section{\color{coral}How do I calculate the Helmholtz (or Gibbs) free energy
as a function of temperature keeping into account the thermal expansion?}
Use \texttt{what='mur\_lc\_t'}. The Helmholtz (or Gibbs at finite pressure) 
free energy is shown as a function of temperature in the file 
\texttt{output\_anharm.ps}. Note that the absolute value of this energy
depends on the pseudopotentials as the total energy. You can however
compare the free energies for different crystal structures 
and predict if a phase transition occurs and at which temperature (also 
as a function of pressure).

\section{\color{coral} How do I calculate the bulk modulus as a function of 
temperature?}
Use \texttt{what='mur\_lc\_t'} and the option \texttt{lmurn=.TRUE.}.
This approach is rigorously valid only for cubic solids, for anisotropic
solid it is only an approximation in which only \texttt{celldm(1)} is
changed while the other crystal parameters are kept constant.

\section{\color{coral} How do I calculate the constant pressure heat capacity?}
Use \texttt{what='mur\_lc\_t'} and the option \texttt{lmurn=.TRUE.}.
This approach is rigorously valid only for cubic solids, for anisotropic
solid it is only an approximation in which only \texttt{celldm(1)} is
changed while the other crystal parameters are kept constant.

\section{\color{coral} How do I calculate the elastic constants 
as a function of temperature?}
This is a two step calculation. First use 
\texttt{what='elastic\_constants\_t'}. This option computes the elastic
constants for all the geometries used by \texttt{what='mur\_lc\_t'}.
Then copy the directory \texttt{elastic\_constants} in a new directory 
and with the same input for \texttt{pw.x}, run again \texttt{thermo\_pw}
using \texttt{what='mur\_lc\_t'}.
Presently the code computes the temperature dependent elastic constants
only within the ``quasi-static'' approximation, meaning that it interpolates
the elastic constants found in the first step at the geometry that
minimizes the Helmholtz (or Gibbs at finite pressure) free energy. The plot 
of the elastic constants will be found in \texttt{output\_ahar.el\_cons.ps}.
Note that this approach used with the option \texttt{lmurn=.FALSE.} can
calculate the thermodynamic properties of non-cubic solids.

\section{\color{coral} How do I calculate the electronic heat capacity
of a metal?}
Use \texttt{what='scf\_dos'}. See \texttt{example18}. In the metallic
case in addition to a plot of the density of states this option produces
also a plot of the electronic energy, free energy, entropy, heat capacity,
and chemical potential in the standard temperature range if this range is
not given in the \thermo\ input. These quantities are found in the file
\texttt{output\_eltherm.ps} if the name of the postscript
file is not given in the \thermo\ input.
Please keep the default value of \texttt{deltae} or the electronic
thermodynamic properties could be wrong at low temperatures.

\section{\color{coral} How do I calculate the frequency dependent dielectric
constant of a material?}
Use \texttt{what='scf\_ph'}. See \texttt{example16} and \texttt{example20}. 
Please note that this calculation is made by the extended version of the
phonon code available in \thermo, so you have to provide specific flags
to the phonon input. See the user's guide for details. 
The dielectric constant is in the file \texttt{output\_epsilon.ps}.
Note that for metals you need to specify a finite wave-vector {\bf q} and you 
cannot plot the dielectric constant when {\bf q} is the $\Gamma$ point.  
See \texttt{example17} and \texttt{example21} for this case. 

\section{\color{coral} Which is the meaning of the colors in
the electronic bands and phonon dispersions plots?}
Different colors correspond to different irreducible representations of 
the point co-group of the {\bf k} or {\bf q} wavevector. To see the
correspondence color-representation see the \texttt{point\_groups.pdf} 
manual. The point group used for each {\bf k} or {\bf q} point is
written in the \thermo\ output and also in the plot if you set
\texttt{enhance\_plot=.TRUE.}. In the output you can also find,
close to each band energy or phonon frequency value, the name of the
irreducible representation. Relevant character tables are given in the
\texttt{point\_groups.pdf} manual, in the \thermo\ output, or by the
\texttt{crystal\_point\_group.x} tool.
