\section{\color{coral}Introduction}
\qe\ and \tpw\ can determine the point group of a
solid, the symmetry of its physical properties, the symmetry
of the electronic wavefunctions and of the phonon modes. The proper interpretation
of these symmetry information requires the knowledge of the conventions on the 
underlying point groups. This guide illustrates these conventions
for a better interpretation of the output of these codes. \\
For each point group we give: 
\begin{itemize}

\item
The crystal system and the Bravais lattices compatible with the point
group.

\item
The Laue class.

\item
A brief description of the symmetry operations. 
A description of the possible orientations of the rotation axes and of the 
mirror planes with respect to the Cartesian axes.

\item
The character table and a description of the main characteristic of each 
irreducible representation.

\item
The character table of the double group and a description of the main 
characteristic of each irreducible representation.

\item
The character tables of the nonequivalents projective representations for the 
groups that have them.

\item
A list of the possible subgroups and the relative orientation of the symmetry
elements of these subgroups.

\item
A subgroup compatibility table of the irreducible representations.

\item
A subgroup compatibility table of the double-group irreducible representations. 

\end{itemize}
Other information on the crystallographic points groups used by the code 
not reported in the present manual can be obtained using the tool 
\texttt{crystal\_point\_group.x}. Among them we mention:
\begin{itemize}

\item A complete listing of the symmetry operations of each group
and their $O(3)$ and $SU(2)$ matrices.

\item A complete listing of all point subgroups and supergroups.

\item A multiplication table of all the double point groups.

\item A compatibility table of all the projective representations.

\item A table of all the Kronecker products of the representations and
their decomposition into the irreducible or projective representations
of all the subgroups.

\item The irreducible representations of the translations and of the rotations
for each point group.

\item The decomposition of all the integer or seminteger representations
of the rotation group into irreducible representations of any of the point groups.

\item The decomposition of all the products of the irreducible representations 
of the group times the integer and seminteger representations of the 
rotation group into irreducible representations of the point group.

\end{itemize}
It is assumed that the reader has a basic understanding of group theory and
of its use for the characterization of molecules and solids.
The mathematical theory behind these applications is described, 
at various levels of detail, in several books (see for instance the small 
bibliography at the end of this guide) and is not reported here. 
For the following discussion it is useful to read the Brillouin zone 
manual that you can find in the \texttt{Doc} sub-directory of the 
\qe\ distribution. For each Bravais lattice, the primitive lattice vectors
and their orientation with respect to the Cartesian axes, as given by the
\qe\ routines, are described there and here we assume that the reader has a
basic understanding of these primitive vectors. \\
These notes are part of the \tpw\ package. The complete package is
available at \texttt{https://github.com/dalcorso/thermo\_pw}.

\section{\color{coral}Overview}
In \qe\ and \tpw, the $32$ crystallographic point groups 
(point groups in the following) are identified by an integer number 
(the group code) and 
by a string (the group name) according to the following table:

\begin{verbatim}
 1  "C_1 (1)    ", 2  "C_i (-1)   ", 3  "C_s (m)    ", 4  "C_2  (2)   ", 
 5  "C_3 (3)    ", 6  "C_4 (4)    ", 7  "C_6 (6)    ", 8  "D_2  (222) ", 
 9  "D_3 (32)   ", 10 "D_4 (422)  ", 11 "D_6 (622)  ", 12 "C_2v (mm2) ", 
 13 "C_3v (3m)  ", 14 "C_4v (4mm) ", 15 "C_6v (6mm) ", 16 "C_2h (2/m) ", 
 17 "C_3h (-6)  ", 18 "C_4h (4/m) ", 19 "C_6h (6/m) ", 20 "D_2h (mmm) ", 
 21 "D_3h (-62m)", 22 "D_4h(4/mmm)", 23 "D_6h(6/mmm)", 24 "D_2d (-42m)", 
 25 "D_3d (-3m) ", 26 "S_4 (-4)   ", 27 "S_6 (-3)   ", 28 "T    (23)  ", 
 29 "T_h (m-3)  ", 30 "T_d (-43m) ", 31 "O   (432)  ", 32 "O_h (m-3m) "  
\end{verbatim}
All symmetry operations are conventionally divided in $6$ 
different types, with an integer number identifying the symmetry type:
\begin{verbatim}
   1 identity                          E
   2 inversion                         i
   3 proper rotation /= 180 degrees    C3, C4, or C6
   4 proper rotation of 180 degrees    C2
   5 mirror                            s
   6 improper rotation /= 180 degrees  S3, S4, or S6
\end{verbatim}
The point group is identified by counting the number of symmetry operations of 
each type. \\
An extended group code is also available for a more easy control of the
point group. This number is reported in the following manual close
to the description of each group.
The point group representations can be used to classify the symmetry properties 
of the electronic wavefunctions for wave-vectors inside the Brillouin zone. 
For wave-vectors on the Brillouin zone surface this is possible only for 
symmorphic space groups. Non-symmorphic space groups require the projective 
representations of the point groups. 
The point groups have up to $12$ irreducible 
representations distinguished in the electronic bands or phonon dispersions
plots produced by \tpw\ by a different color. \\
The color codes for each representation are the following:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=16cm]{color.png} 
\end{center}
\begin{verbatim}
    1 -> red            2 -> green        3 -> blue           4 -> cyan
    5 -> magenta        6 -> gold         7 -> pink           8 -> black
    9 -> olive         10 -> brown       11 -> light-blue    12 -> orange
\end{verbatim} 
The number of each irreducible representation corresponds to its position
in the character table and is given below after the list of characters. 
Group of bands degenerate by time reversal might belong to a reducible
representation. In that case the bands are plotted with the color of the
irreducible representation with higher number contained in the decomposition
of the reducible representation.
The names of the irreducible representations have been taken from Ref.~[1]
for the point groups and from Ref.~[2] for the double point groups. 
The character tables of the $32$ point groups can be found in many places 
but the conventions and definitions can be slightly different. So in
this guide we include the tables as a reference even if there is some 
overlap with Ref.~[2]. The tables are those printed by the \qe\ 
routines. For each character only two digits are given, so the
following correspondence should be used:
$1.41 \rightarrow \sqrt{2}$, $1.73 \rightarrow \sqrt{3}$, 
$0.71 \rightarrow \sqrt{2}/2$, $0.87 \rightarrow \sqrt{3}/2$.
For the proper point groups or improper point groups isomorphic to a 
proper point group and for $S_6$ and $T_h$ all the projective 
representations are p-equivalent to the representations of the single 
or of the double point group.~[11] For the groups $C_{2h}$, $C_{4h}$, $C_{6h}$,
$D_{3d}$, and $O_h$ there is an additional nonequivalent projective 
set of representations, while for $D_{2h}$, $D_{4h}$, and $D_{6h}$ there 
are three additional projective sets that are reported in the tables below.
In a projective representation, elements belonging to the 
same class might have different characters so we report in the tables all 
the elements that have non-zero character (except for $O_h$ whose
projective table is given for groups of operations that have the same
non-zero character). 
Only one representative example of the many possible realizations of 
the point group is given. You can use the tool code 
\texttt{crystal\_point\_group.x} to have more precise information
on each point group. The names 
of these projective representations are taken from Ref.~[11] (and converted
to the name used in this manual for the representations of the point group 
and of the double point group) while the same color codes as described above 
are used for the projective representations (this feature is available
only in \texttt{thermo\_pw}).

The names of the symmetry operations are indicated using
the Sch\"onflies notation. 
We assume that the orientation of the axes is with the tip in the positive
$z$ hemisphere and positive rotation angles are counterclockwise about 
the rotation axis when seen from the tip to the origin. Axes in the $z=0$ 
plane are oriented with the tip in the
positive $x$ direction, and the $y$ axis is oriented in the 
direction of positive $y$. In this guide, improper rotations are described 
as rotations followed by inversion as in the Hermann-Mauguin (HM) 
definitions. In the Schoenflies notation improper rotations are rotations
followed by a mirror symmetry with respect to a plane perpendicular to 
the rotation axis.
So $S_6^5$ indicates a rotation of $+120^\circ$ degree about the axis 
followed by inversion (this operation is called $\bar 3$ in 
HM notation), $S_6$ a rotation of 
$-120^\circ$ followed by inversion ($\bar 3^5$), $S_3^5$ a rotation 
of $+60^\circ$ followed by inversion ($\bar 6$) and
$S_3$ a rotation of $-60^\circ$ followed by inversion ($\bar 6^5$).
$S_4^3$ is a rotation of $+90^\circ$ followed by inversion ($\bar 4$) and
$S_4$ is a rotation of $-90^\circ$ followed by inversion ($\bar 4^3$).
For the double groups a minus sign in front of the symmetry name
indicates that the operation is multiplied by the $360^\circ$ rotation 
(called \texttt{-E} in the tables or $\bar E$ in the text).

\subsection{\color{web-blue}$C_{6v}\ (6mm)$} 
This group has twelve elements: The identity, two rotations of $\pm60^\circ$ 
about an axis ($C_6$ and $C_6^5$), two rotations of $\pm120^\circ$
about the same axis ($C_3$ and $C_3^2$), a rotation of $180^\circ$ about 
the same axis ($C_2$), and six mirror symmetries with respect to
planes ($3\sigma_v$ and $3\sigma_d$) that contain the $C_6$ axis \texttt{[81]}.
It is a group compatible with the hexagonal system and with the  
hexagonal (\texttt{ibrav=4}) Bravais lattice. \\ 
Its Laue class is $D_{6h}$. \\
The $C_6$ axis is the $z$ axis. The mirror planes $\sigma_v$ are perpendicular 
to $y$ and to $(y=\pm x/\sqrt{3}, z=0)$, while the mirror planes $\sigma_d$
are perpendicular to $x$ and to $(y=\pm \sqrt{3} x, z=0)$.
There is therefore $1$ realization of interest for solids. \\
The character table is (isomorphic to $D_6$ with $\sigma_d \rightarrow C_2'$

There are three two-dimensional irreducible representations that can be 
distinguished for the character of the $C_6$ rotations, equal to $\sqrt{3}$
according to $\Gamma_7$, to $-\sqrt{3}$ according to $\Gamma_8$ and to
$0$ according to $\Gamma_9$.\\
The subgroups of $C_{6v}$ are $C_1$, $C_s$, $C_2$, $C_3$, $C_6$,
$C_{2v}$, and $C_{3v}$. The rotation axes of $C_2$, $C_3$, $C_6$, $C_{2v}$,
and $C_{3v}$ coincide with the rotation axis of $C_{6v}$. The mirror 
plane of $C_s$ can be a $\sigma_d$ (case 1) or a $\sigma_v$ (case 2). The two 
mirror planes of $C_{2v}$
can coincide with the two planes perpendicular to $x$ and $y$, 
or perpendicular to $(y=\sqrt{3} x, z=0)$ and $(y=-x /\sqrt{3}, z=0)$,
or perpendicular to $(y=-\sqrt{3} x, z=0)$ and $(y=x /\sqrt{3}, z=0)$.
There are therefore two possibilities. The plane $\sigma_v$ of $C_{2v}$
can coincide with one of the planes $\sigma_d$ (case 1) of $C_{2v}$
or with one of the planes $\sigma_v$ (case 2).
The three mirror planes of $C_{3v}$ can coincide with the three mirrors

This group has four elements: The identity, a rotation of $180^\circ$ 
about an axis ($C_2$), inversion and a mirror symmetry with respect to

It is a group compatible with the monoclinic system and with the

\subsection{\color{web-blue}$C_{4h}\ (4/m)$}  
This group has eight elements: The identity, two rotation of $\pm90^\circ$ 
about an axis ($C_4$ and $C_4^3$), a rotation of $180^\circ$ about the
same axis ($C_2$), inversion, and the product of inversion with previous
rotations that gives two rotations of $\pm90^\circ$ multiplied by inversion 
($S_4^3$ and $S_4$) and a mirror symmetry $\sigma_h$ with respect to a plane 
perpendicular to the $C_4$ axis.  
It is a group compatible with the tetragonal system and with the  
simple tetragonal (\texttt{ibrav=6}) and centered tetragonal (\texttt{ibrav=7})

Its Laue class is $C_{4h}$. \\
The $C_4$ axis can be parallel to $x$ \texttt{[98]}, $y$ \texttt{[97]},

\subsection{\color{web-blue}$D_{2h}\ (mmm)$ or $V_h$}  
This group has eight elements: The identity, three rotation of $180^\circ$
about three perpendicular axes ($C_2$, $C_2'$, and $C_2''$),
inversion and three mirror symmetries with respect to planes perpendicular to
the $C_2$, $C_2'$ and $C_2''$ axes ($\sigma_v$, $\sigma_v'$, and $\sigma_v''$).
It is a group compatible with the orthorhombic system and with the
simple orthorhombic (\texttt{ibrav=8}) and base-centered 
orthorhombic (\texttt{ibrav=9}), face-centered orthorhombic (\texttt{ibrav=10}),
body-centered orthorhombic (\texttt{ibrav=11}) Bravais lattices. \\
Its Laue class is $D_{2h}$. \\
The three perpendicular axes can be:
\begin{itemize}
\item
a) $z$ ($C_2$), $x$ ($C_2'$), and $y$ ($C_2''$) \texttt{[100]}
\item
b) $x$ ($C_2$), ($y=z$, $x=0$) ($C_2'$), ($y=-z$, $x=0$) ($C_2''$) 
\texttt{[101]}
\item
c) $y$ ($C_2$), ($x=-z$, $y=0$) ($C_2'$), ($x=z$, $y=0$) ($C_2''$) 
\texttt{[102]}
\item
d) $z$ ($C_2$), ($y=-x$, $z=0$) ($C_2'$), ($y=x$, $z=0$) ($C_2''$) 
\texttt{[103]}
\item
e) $z$ ($C_2$), ($y=-x/\sqrt{3}$, $z=0$) ($C_2'$), ($y=\sqrt{3}x$, $z=0$) 
($C_2''$) \texttt{[104]}
\item
f) $z$ ($C_2$), ($y=-\sqrt{3}x$, $z=0$) ($C_2'$), ($y=x/\sqrt{3}$, $z=0$) 
($C_2''$) \texttt{[105]}
\end{itemize}
The mirrors $\sigma_v$, $\sigma_v'$, and $\sigma_v''$  are perpendicular to 
the $C_2$, $C_2'$, and $C_2''$ axes, respectively.
There are therefore $6$ realizations of interest in solids. \\

There are eight one-dimensional irreducible representations. $A_g$, $B_{1g}$,
$B_{2g}$, and $B_{3g}$ are even with respect to inversion while $A_u$, $B_{1u}$,
$B_{2u}$, and $B_{3u}$ are odd. $A$, $B_1$, $B_2$, and $B_3$ can be distinguished,
after deciding which axis is $C_2$, which axis is $C_2'$, and which axis
is $C_2''$, according to the symmetry with respect to these rotations.
$A$ is totally symmetric with respect to rotations, $B_1$ is even with
respect to $C_2$ and odd with respect to $C_2'$ and $C_2''$, 
$B_2$ is even with respect to $C_2'$ and odd with respect to $C_2$ and $C_2''$,

There are two two-dimensional irreducible representations. $\Gamma_5^+$ is 
even with respect to inversion and $\Gamma_5^-$ is odd. \\
The subgroups of $D_{2h}$ are $C_1$, $C_i$, $C_s$, $C_2$, $D_2$, $C_{2v}$, and
$C_{2h}$. The axis of $C_2$ is parallel to one of
the axis of $D_{2h}$, $C_2$ (case 1), $C_2'$ (case 2), or $C_2''$ (case 3). 
The mirror of $C_s$ is one of the mirrors of $D_{2h}$,
so it can coincide with $\sigma_v$ (case 1), $\sigma_v'$ (case 2), or
$\sigma_v''$ (case 3). The axes of $D_2$ must be chosen in the same order
as those of $D_{2h}$. The axis of $C_{2v}$ can coincide with $C_2$
(cases 1,4), with $C_2'$ (case 2,5) or with $C_2''$ (case 3,6). The two mirrors
are those that contain the axis, so $\sigma_v'$ and $\sigma_v''$
in case 1,4, $\sigma_v$ and $\sigma_v''$ in case 2,5, and $\sigma_v$ and 
$\sigma_v'$ in case 3,6. The two mirrors must be assigned to $\sigma_v$ and
$\sigma_v'$ of $C_{2v}$ with the same conventions used to define the character 
table of $C_{2v}$. We have therefore $6$ cases summarized in the following table:
\begin{verbatim}
C_2v            C_2            s_v        s_v'     case
D_2h            C_2            s_v'       s_v''      1
D_2h            C_2            s_v''      s_v'       2
D_2h            C_2'           s_v        s_v''      3

D_2h            C_2''          s_v        s_v'       5
D_2h            C_2''          s_v'       s_v        6
\end{verbatim}
The axis of $C_{2h}$ is parallel to $C_2$ (case 1),
to $C_2'$ (case 2) or to $C_2''$ (case 3) and the mirror is perpendicular
to the axis, so it coincides with $\sigma_v$ in case 1, with $\sigma_v'$ in
case 2 and with $\sigma_v''$ in case 3. \\

\subsection{\color{web-blue}$D_{3h}\ (\bar 62m)$} 
This group has twelve elements: The identity, two rotations of $\pm120^\circ$
about an axis ($C_3$ and $C_3^2$), three rotations of $180^\circ$
about three axes ($3C_2$) perpendicular to the $C_3$ axis,
a mirror symmetry with respect to a plane perpendicular to the $C_3$ axis 
($\sigma_h$) and the product of this mirror symmetry with previous rotations
that gives two rotations of $\pm 60^\circ$ multiplied by inversion 
($S_3^5$ and $S_3$) about the $C_3$ axis and three mirror symmetries with respect 
to planes that contain the $C_3$ axis and one of the $3C_2$ axes
($3\sigma_v$). 
It is a group compatible with the hexagonal system 
and with the hexagonal (\texttt{ibrav=4}) Bravais lattice. \\
Its Laue class is $D_{6h}$. \\
The $C_3$ axis is $z$.
The three $C_2$ axes can be: $x$, ($y=\pm \sqrt{3} x$, $z=0$) (a) 
\texttt{[106]}, or
$y$, ($y=\pm x/\sqrt{3}$, $z=0$) (b) \texttt{[107]}. 
In case (a) the mirror planes 
$3\sigma_v$ are perpendicular to the $3C_2$ axes of case (b) and in case (b) 
they are perpendicular to the $3C_2$ axes of case (a).
There are therefore $2$ realizations of interest for solids. \\
The character table is (using $D_{3h}=D_3 \times \sigma_h$):

There are six irreducible representations. $A_1'$, $A_2'$, and $E'$ are

$A_1''$, $A_2''$, and $E''$ are odd. The representations $E$ are
two dimensional. The one-dimensional representations $A_1$ and $A_2$ can

while $A_2$ is odd. \\

The subgroups of $D_{3h}$ are $C_1$, $C_s$, $C_2$, $C_3$, $D_3$, $C_{2v}$,

The axis of $C_2$ can coincide with any of the three $C_2$ axis of $D_{3h}$. 
The axes of $C_3$, $D_3$, $C_{3v}$, and $C_{3h}$ coincide with the $C_3$ axis

The $C_2$ axis of $C_{2v}$ coincides with one of the three axis of $D_{3h}$.
The mirror $\sigma_v$ of $C_{2v}$ can coincide with the $\sigma_h$ mirror of $D_{3h}$
and the mirror $\sigma_v'$ of $C_{2h}$ coincides with the mirror $\sigma_v$ 
of $D_{3h}$ that contains the $C_2$ axis of $C_{2v}$ (case 1) or
the mirror $\sigma_v$ of $C_{2v}$ coincides with the $\sigma_v$ mirror of $D_{3h}$
that contains the $C_2$ axis of $C_{2v}$ and the mirror $\sigma_v'$ of $C_{2h}$ 
coincides with the mirror $\sigma_h$ of $D_{3h}$ (case 2). 
The three mirror planes of $C_{3v}$ coincide with the three mirror planes

When the $C_4$ axis is $z$ the four $C_2$ axes are : $x$, $y$ ($2C_2'$),
($y=\pm x$, $z=0$) ($2C_2''$).  
There are therefore $3$ realizations of interest for solids. \\

\subsection{\color{web-blue}$D_{6h}\ (6/mmm)$} 
This group has twenty-four elements: The identity, two rotations of 
$\pm60^\circ$ about an axis ($C_6$ and $C_6^5$), two rotations of 
$\pm120^\circ$ about the same axis ($C_3$ and $C_3^2$), a rotation of 
$180^\circ$ about the same axis ($C_2$), six rotations of $180^\circ$ 
($3C_2'$ and $3C_2''$) about six axes perpendicular to the $C_6$ axis,
inversion, and the product of inversion with previous rotations that gives
two rotations of $\pm60^\circ$ about the
$C_6$ axis multiplied by inversion ($S_3^5$ and $S_3$), two rotations of 
$\pm120^\circ$ about the $C_6$ axis multiplied by inversion 
($S_6^5$ and $S_6$), a mirror plane 
perpendicular to the $C_6$ axis ($\sigma_h$), six mirrors perpendicular 
to $3C_2'$ and $3C_2''$ ($3\sigma_d$ and $3\sigma_v$) \texttt{[111]}.
It is a group compatible with the hexagonal system
and with the hexagonal (\texttt{ibrav=4}) Bravais lattice. \\
Its Laue class is $D_{6h}$. \\
The $C_6$ axis is the $z$ axis, the three $C_2'$ axes are 
$x$, $(y=\pm\sqrt{3}x, z=0)$, the three $C_2''$ axes
are $y$, $(y=\pm x/\sqrt{3}, z=0)$. The mirror planes
$\sigma_v$ are perpendicular to the $C_2''$ axes, while $\sigma_d$ are
perpendicular to the $C_2'$ axes. There is therefore $1$ realization
of interest for solids. \\
The character table is (using $D_{6h}=D_6 \times C_i$):

There are twelve irreducible representations. $A_{1g}$, $A_{2g}$, $B_{1g}$, 
$B_{2g}$, $E_{1g}$, and $E_{2g}$ are even with respect to inversion, while
$A_{1u}$, $A_{2u}$, $B_{1u}$, $B_{2u}$, $E_{1u}$, and $E_{2u}$ are odd.
The representations $E_1$ and $E_2$ are two dimensional and can be
distinguished because the character of the representation for the $C_2$ 
rotation about the $C_6$ axis is $-2$ according to $E_1$ and $2$ according
to $E_2$. The one-dimensional representations $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1$ and
$B_2$ have different behavior with respect to the two rotations $C_2'$ and
$C_2''$. $A_1$ is even with respect to both rotations, $A_2$ is odd with
respect to both rotations, $B_1$ is even with respect to $C_2'$ and odd with
respect to $C_2''$, while $B_2$ is odd with respect to $C_2'$ and even with
respect to $C_2''$. \\

There are six two-dimensional irreducible representations $\Gamma_7^+$,
$\Gamma_8^+$, and $\Gamma_9^+$ have positive character for inversion, while
$\Gamma_7^-$, $\Gamma_8^-$, and $\Gamma_9^-$ have negative character. 
$\Gamma_7$, $\Gamma_8$,
and $\Gamma_9$ can be distinguished for the character with respect to the $C_6$
rotations. It is $\sqrt{3}$ according to $\Gamma_7$, $-\sqrt{3}$ according
to $\Gamma_8$ and $0$ according to $\Gamma_9$.\\
The subgroups of $D_{6h}$ are $C_1$, $C_i$, $C_s$, $C_2$, $C_3$, $C_6$,
$D_2$, $D_3$, $D_6$, $C_{2v}$, $C_{3v}$, $C_{6v}$, $C_{2h}$, $C_{3h}$,

The mirror of $C_s$ can be chosen coinciding with $\sigma_h$ (case 1), 
with $\sigma_d$ (case 2), or with $\sigma_v$ (case 3). The $C_2$ axis of 
$C_2$ can coincide with the $C_6$ axis of $D_{6h}$ (case 1), with one

coincides with the $C_6$ axis of $D_{6h}$ and the $\sigma_h$ mirror plane
of $C_{3h}$ coincides with $\sigma_h$ of $D_{6h}$.

\subsection{\color{web-blue}$D_{2d}\ (\bar 42m)$} 
This group has eight elements: The identity, two improper rotations 
of $\pm90^\circ$ about an axis ($S_4^3$ and $S_4$), a rotation of 
$180^\circ$ about the same axis ($C_2$), two rotations of $180^\circ$ about
two axes perpendicular to the $S_4$ axis ($2C_2'$) and two mirror symmetries
whose planes contain the $S_4$ axis ($2\sigma_d$).
It is a group compatible with the tetragonal system and with the simple 
tetragonal (\texttt{ibrav=6}) or the centered tetragonal (\texttt{ibrav=7}) 
Bravais lattices. \\
Its Laue class is $D_{4h}$. \\
The $S_4$ axis can be $x$, $y$, or $z$. There are several possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item a) $S_4$ axis parallel to $x$, $C_2'$ axes $y$ and $z$, $\sigma_d$
perpendicular to $(y=\pm z, x=0)$ \texttt{[116]}.
\item b) $S_4$ axis parallel to $x$, $C_2'$ axes $(y=\pm z, x=0)$, $\sigma_d$
perpendicular to $y$ and $z$ \texttt{[117]}.
\item c) $S_4$ axis parallel to $y$, $C_2'$ axes $x$ and $z$, $\sigma_d$
perpendicular to $(x=\pm z, y=0)$ \texttt{[114]}.
\item d) $S_4$ axis parallel to $y$, $C_2'$ axes $(x=\pm z, y=0)$, $\sigma_d$
perpendicular to $x$ and $z$ \texttt{[115]}.
\item e) $S_4$ axis parallel to $z$, $C_2'$ axes $x$ and $y$, $\sigma_d$
perpendicular to $(y=\pm x, z=0)$ \texttt{[112]}.
\item f) $S_4$ axis parallel to $z$, $C_2'$ axes $(y=\pm x, z=0)$, $\sigma_d$
perpendicular to $x$ and $y$ \texttt{[113]}.
\end{itemize}
There are therefore $6$ realizations of interest for solids.\\
The character table is (isomorphic to $D_4$ with $S_4 \rightarrow C_4$
and $\sigma_d \rightarrow C_2''$):

There are five irreducible representations. $A_1$ is totally symmetric, $E$
is two dimensional and $A_2$, $B_1$, and $B_2$ can be recognized according to
the behavior with respect to the $C_2'$ rotations and the $\sigma_d$
mirror symmetries. $A_2$ is odd with respect to both operations, $B_1$ is
even with respect to the $C_2'$ rotation and odd with respect to the
$\sigma_d$ symmetry, $B_2$ is odd with respect to the $C_2'$ rotation and 
even with respect to the $\sigma_d$ symmetry. \\

\end{verbatim}
There are two two-dimensional representations that can be distinguished
for the character for an $S_4$ rotation. The character is $\sqrt{2}$
according to $\Gamma_6$ and $-\sqrt{2}$ according to $\Gamma_7$. \\
The subgroups of $D_{2d}$ are $C_1$, $C_s$, $C_2$, $D_2$, $C_{2v}$, 
and $S_4$. The mirror of $C_s$ coincides with one of the mirror $\sigma_d$. 
The axis of $C_2$ can be the $S_4$ axis (case 1) or one of the 
$C_2'$ axes (case 2). The axes of $C_{2v}$ and $S_4$
coincide with the $S_4$ axis of $D_{2d}$. The mirrors of $C_{2v}$
coincide with the mirrors $\sigma_d$ of $D_{2d}$. For $D_2$ we have several 
possibilities: the axis $C_2$ of $D_2$ coincides with the axis $S_4$
of $D_{2d}$ and the other two axes of $D_2$ coincide with the $C_2'$ axes
of $D_{2d}$ (case 1), the axis $C_2'$ of $D_2$ coincides with the axis $S_4$
of $D_{2d}$ and the other two axes of $D_2$ coincide with the $C_2'$ axes
of $D_{2d}$ (case 2), the axis $C_2''$ of $D_2$ coincides with the axis 
$S_4$ of $D_{2d}$ and the other two axes of $D_2$ coincide with the $C_2'$ 
axis of $D_{2d}$ (case 3). \\

This group has twelve elements: The identity, two improper rotations 
of $\pm120^\circ$ about an axis ($S_6^5$ and $S_6$), two rotation of 
$\pm120^\circ$ about the same axis ($C_3$ and $C_3^2$), inversion,
three rotations of $180^\circ$ about three axes perpendicular to the

It is a group compatible with the trigonal or hexagonal systems and with the

The six-fold rotoinversion axis can be: $z$, $x=y=z$, $x=-y=z$,
$x=-y=-z$, $x=y=-z$.
When the $S_6$ axis is $z$ the $C_2'$ axes can be:
$x$, $(y=\pm\sqrt{3}x, z=0)$ \texttt{[118]}or $y$, $(y=\pm x/\sqrt{3}, z=0)$
\texttt{[119]}. The mirror
planes $\sigma_d$ are perpendicular to the $C_2'$ axes.
When the $S_6$ axis is $x=y=z$ the $C_2'$ axes are $(y=-z, x=0)$, 
$(x=-z, y=0)$, and $(y=-x, z=0)$ \texttt{[120]}. 
When the $S_6$ axis is $x=-y=z$ 
the $C_2'$ axes are $(y=z, x=0)$, $(x=-z, y=0)$, and $(y=x, z=0)$
\texttt{[121]}. 
When the $S_6$ axis is $x=-y=-z$ the $C_2'$ axes are $(y=-z, x=0)$, 
$(x=z, y=0)$, and $(y=x, z=0)$ \texttt{[122]}. When the $S_6$ axis is 
$x=y=-z$ the $C_2'$ axes are $(y=z, x=0)$, $(x=z, y=0)$, and $(y=-x, z=0)$
\texttt{[123]}. The mirror planes are perpendicular to the $C_2'$ axes.
There are therefore $6$ realizations of interest for solids. \\

This group has twenty-four elements: The identity, eight rotations 
of $\pm120^\circ$ about four axes ($8C_3$), three rotations of 
$180^\circ$ about three different axes ($3C_2$), six
improper rotations of $\pm90^\circ$ about the $C_2$ axes and
six mirror symmetries ($6\sigma_d$) with axes described below \texttt{[134]}.
It is a group compatible with the cubic system and with the  
simple (\texttt{ibrav=1}), face-centered (\texttt{ibrav=2}), 
and body-centered cubic (\texttt{ibrav=3}) Bravais lattices. \\
Its Laue class is $O_{h}$. \\
The four axes $C_3$ are $x=y=z$, $x=-y=z$, $x=-y=-z$, $x=y=-z$, while
the three axes $S_4$ are $x$, $y$, $z$. 
The six mirrors $\sigma_d$ are perpendicular to $(y=\pm z, x=0)$,
$(x=\pm z, y=0)$, $(y=\pm x, z=0)$.
There is therefore $1$ realization of interest for solids. \\

of the $C_4$ axis of $O_h$ while the $C_2'$ and $C_2''$ coincide 
with the $C_2'$ axes of $O_h$ (case 2). The $C_3$ axis of $D_3$ coincides with
one of the four $C_3$ axes of $O_h$ and the three $C_2$ axes coincide with
the three $C_2'$ axes of $O_h$ perpendicular to the $C_3$ axis. The $C_4$
axis of $D_4$ coincides with one of the $C_4$ axes of $O_h$ and the
$C_2'$ axes coincide with the other two $C_4$ axes while the $C_2''$ axes
of $C_4$ coincide with the two $C_2'$ axes of $O_h$ perpendicular to the
$C_4$ axis of $D_4$. The $C_2$ axis of $C_{2v}$ can coincide with one of
the $C_4$ axes of $O_h$ and the two mirror planes can coincide with two
$\sigma_h$ planes (case 1) or with two $\sigma_d$ planes (case 2). The
$C_2$ axis of $C_{2v}$ can also coincide with one of the $C_2'$ axes
of $O_h$ and the two mirror planes are the $\sigma_h$ and the $\sigma_d$ 
that contain the axis. We can distinguish two cases. In the first (case 3)
the plane $\sigma_v$ of $C_{2v}$ coincides the plane $\sigma_h$ of $O_h$, 
in the second case (case 4) the plane $\sigma_v'$ of $C_{2v}$ coincides 
the plane $\sigma_h$ of $O_h$.
The $C_3$ axis of $C_{3v}$ coincides with one of the $C_3$ axes of $O_h$ and
the three mirror planes are the $\sigma_d$ that contain the $C_3$ axis.
The $C_4$ axis of $C_{4v}$ coincides with one of the $C_4$ axes of $O_h$
and the mirror planes $\sigma_v$ of $C_{4v}$ coincide with the $\sigma_h$
planes of $O_h$ that contain the $C_4$ axis of $C_{4v}$, 
while the mirror planes $\sigma_d$ of $C_{4v}$ coincide
with the $\sigma_d$ planes of $O_h$ that contain the $C_4$ axis of $C_{4v}$.
The $C_2$ axis of $C_{2h}$ can be one of the $C_4$ axes of $O_h$ and
the $\sigma_h$ mirror coincides with the $\sigma_h$ mirror of $O_h$ 
perpendicular to the $C_2$ axis of $C_{2h}$ (case 1).
The other possibility is that the $C_2$ axis of $C_{2h}$ is one of 
the $C_2'$ axes of $O_h$ and the mirror $\sigma_h$ of $C_{2h}$ coincides with
the $\sigma_d$ mirror of $O_h$ perpendicular to the $C_2$ axis of $C_{2h}$
(case 2). The $C_4$ axis of $C_{4h}$ coincides with one of the
$C_4$ axes of $O_h$. The mirror perpendicular to the $C_4$ axis is one of
the $\sigma_h$ mirrors of $O_h$. 
The $C_2$ axis of $D_{2h}$ coincides with one of the $C_4$ axes of $O_h$. 
The $C_2'$ and the $C_2''$ axes of $D_{2h}$ can coincide with the other two 
$C_4$ axes of $O_h$ (case 1) or with the two $C_2'$ axes of $O_h$
perpendicular to the $C_2$ axis of $D_{2h}$ (case 2). The mirror planes of 
$D_{2h}$ are those 
perpendicular to these axes: the three $\sigma_h$ of $O_h$ in case 1 and a
$\sigma_h$ and two $\sigma_d$ of $O_h$ in case 2. $\sigma_v$ of $D_{2h}$
coincides with $\sigma_h$ of $O_h$ while $\sigma_v'$ and $\sigma_v''$
of $D_{2h}$ coincide with two $\sigma_d$ of $O_h$.
The $C_4$ axis of $D_{4h}$ is
one of the $C_4$ axis of $O_h$ and the two $C_2'$ axes of $D_{4h}$ coincide 
with the other two $C_4$ axes of $O_h$ while the two axes $C_2''$ of $D_{4h}$ 
coincide with the $C_2'$ axes of $O_h$ perpendicular to the $C_4$ axis of 
$D_{4h}$.
The mirror $\sigma_h$ of $D_{4h}$ coincides with the mirror $\sigma_h$ of
$O_h$ perpendicular to the $C_4$ axis of $D_{4h}$.
The $S_4$ axis of $D_{2d}$ coincides with one of the $C_4$ axis of $O_h$,
the $C_2'$ axes of $D_{2d}$ can coincide with the other $C_4$ axes of 
$O_h$ (case 1) or with the $C_2'$ axes of $O_h$ perpendicular to the $S_4$ 
axis of $D_{2d}$ (case 2). The two mirrors $\sigma_d$ of $D_{2d}$ are 
perpendicular to $C_2'$ axes of $D_{2d}$ of case 2 in case 1 and to the $C_2'$
axes of $D_{2d}$ of case 1 in case 2.
The $S_6$ axis of $D_{3d}$ coincides with one of the $C_3$ axes
of $O_h$, the three perpendicular axes $C_2'$ of $D_{3d}$ are the three axes 
$C_2'$ of $O_h$ perpendicular to the $S_6$ axis of $D_{3d}$. The mirror planes 
$\sigma_d$ of $D_{3d}$ are the $\sigma_d$ of $O_h$ perpendicular to the $C_2'$ 
axes of $D_{3d}$.
The $S_4$ axis of $S_4$ coincides with one of the $C_4$ axis of $O_h$. 
The $S_6$ axis of $S_6$ coincides with one of the $C_3$ axes of $O_h$. 
The $C_3$ and $C_2$ axes of $T$, $T_h$, $T_d$, and
$O$ coincide with those of $O_h$, and the $S_4$ and $C_2'$ axes of $T_d$ and
the $C_4$ and $C_2'$ axes of $O$ coincide with those of $O_h$. \\

\section{\color{coral}Symmetry matrices
\label{section_sym}}
\subsection{\color{web-blue}O(3)}
\qe\ uses internally the following symmetry matrices. Each one of these
matrices is checked as a possible symmetry in the given order. The extended
description of the symmetry operations is the one printed by \qe. Moreover
I added two symbols not present in the output of the codes. The
first symbol indicates the generic name of the symmetry used in the character
tables of the point groups and double point groups. The second symbol is
a more detailed description of the symmetry and is used in the character
tables of the projective representations. The number $n$ in the symbol 
indicates the rotation angle ($2 \pi / n$ or $360^\circ/n$), the following
letters indicate the rotation axis (for instance \texttt{z} indicates the 
$z$ axis, \texttt{x-y} indicates the axis $y=-x, z=0$ and \texttt{xyz} 
indicates the axis $x=y=z$).
A letter \texttt{i} in front of the symbol indicates multiplication

The directions of the rotation axes or the perpendicular to the mirror

\begin{center}

$[n_1,n_2,n_3]$ indicates a direction parallel
to the Bravais lattice $n_1 {\bf a}_1 + n_2 {\bf a}_2 + n_3 {\bf a}_3$
where ${\bf a}_1$ is along $x$, ${\bf a}_2$ is rotated 
of $120^\circ$ in the $xy$ plane and ${\bf a}_3$ is parallel to the $z$
axis.

\subsection{\color{web-blue}SU(2)}
The application of the rotation operator to a two-component spinor 
wavefunction requires the $2\times2$ matrices of the $SU(2)$ group.
The operation of $SU(2)$ in spin space can be defined by the Cayley-Klein
parameters ($a$ and $b$):
\begin{equation}
U=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
a, & b
\\
-b^*, & a^*
\end{array}
\right).
\nonumber
\end{equation}
There are two matrices of the double point group (differing by a global
sign) that correspond to the same rotation when the difference of $2\pi$ in
the rotation angle is neglected. In order to define the
matrices of the point group it is necessary to choose one $SU(2)$ matrix
for each rotation. The choice is not obvious for $180^\circ$ rotations.
Ref.[11] suggests the following choice of the Cayley-Klein parameters:

a different sign choice is necessary to keep in the same class the three
$C_2$ or $\sigma_v$ operations. \qe\ uses 
Ref.[11] conventions for all groups, without any sign change for
$D_3$, $C_{3v}$, and $D_{3d}$ operations. For these groups we use the
matrices written above changing the character table of the double point

\section{\color{coral}List of the $136$ point groups available in QE}

This is the list of the $136$ realizations of the $32$ crystallographic 
point groups that have been described in this guide and that can be built 
using the symmetry matrices described in 
Sec.~\ref{section_sym}. The first number is
the extended code of the point group that must be given in the input 
of the tool \texttt{crystal\_point\_group.x} to specify a well
defined point group. Name is the Sch\"onflies name of one of the $32$
crystallographic point groups that corresponds to a given realization while
the list of the symmetry operations is given after the name.

\section{\color{coral}Alternative names for the irreducible representations}
Comparison of the output of \thermo\ and of \texttt{pw.x} and \texttt{ph.x} 
with previous literature is sometimes difficult due to the use of different 
names for the irreducible representations. As a rule we have used the names
reported in Ref.~[1] for the representations of the point group and those
of Ref.~[2] for the representations of the double point group
(except for the exchange of $B_1$ and $B_2$ in the names of the $C_{6v}$ 
representations due to the isomorphism with $D_6$). Alternative
names are present in the literature especially to classify the electronic
band structures. Some of these names are written on the output
of \qe. In this Section we describe the origin of these names pointing to
the original papers. Moreover we give a few equivalent names of the irreducible representations found in standard 
group theory books. 
We give a table for each point group. The first column gives the names 
used in this guide, followed by the names used by \qe\ and by 
other references.

$C_s$ is the small group of ${\bf k}$ along the $\Sigma$ line of the 
zinc-blend structure and in Ref.[15] its representations have been given
particular names.

The representations of the $C_3$ group are sometimes labeled by an integer 
$m$, such that the character of the $C_3$ operation is 
$e^{i {2\pi \over 3} m}$. In this case, $A$ is indicated by $m=0$, $E$ and 
$E^*$ by $m=1$ and $m=2$, respectively.

The representations of $C_6$ are sometimes labeled by an integer $m$,
such that the character of the $C_6$ operation is $e^{i {2\pi \over 6} m}$.
In this case $A$ is indicated by $m=0$, $B$ by $m=3$, $E_1$ and $E_1^*$ 
by $m=1$ and $m=5$, and $E_2$ and $E_2^*$ by $m=2$ and $m=4$, respectively.

The names of the representations of $D_2$ depend on the choice of the 
three perpendicular axes $C_2$, $C_2'$ and $C_2''$. The following table 
is purely indicative and corresponds to our choice $z$, $x$, and $y$ 
for the three axes and the choice $z$, $y$, $x$ for Refs.[5,2,11].

The representations of $C_{2v}$ are difficult to distinguish among different
references. While $A_1$ and $A_2$ are distinguishable since the 
$180^\circ$ rotation has character $1$, $B_1$, and $B_2$ depend on which 
are the first and second mirrors. 
We call $B_1$ the representation that has character $1$ on the first mirror and 
$-1$ on the second, but for each group please refer to the $C_{2v}$ section
above to know which are the first and second mirrors. 
This is also the small group
of {\bf k} for the $\Sigma$ and $S$ lines of the simple cubic Brillouin 
zone [14],
for the line $Z$ of the simple cubic, for the line $G$ and $D$ of the bcc, 
for the points $K$ and $U$ of the fcc [14]. $C_{2v}$ is the small group
of ${\bf k}$ along the $\Delta$ line for a zinc-blend structure and
its representations have been given special names in Ref.[15].

The representations of $C_{3v}$ are used to classify the states along the 
$\Lambda$ line of the simple cubic and fcc Brillouin zone and therefore have

The group $D_{4h}$ is the small group of ${\bf k}$ at the $X$ and $M$
point of the simple cubic Brillouin zone so in Ref.[14] its representations 
have been given special names for the use with the $M$ point. The same names 
with the exchange of $M$ with $X$ are used for the $X$ point. Note however
that for the space group $221$ at $M$ Ref.[13] uses different names that
are also widely used.

The representations of $D_{2d}$ are used to classify the states at the
point $W$ of the fcc Brillouin zone and therefore have received special names 
in Ref.[14]. The same group is also used to classify the states at the
$X$ point of the Brillouin zone for a zincblend structure and the
representations have names given in Ref.[15]
