\section{\color{coral}Introduction}
\qe\ and \tpw\ can determine the point group of a
solid, the symmetry of its physical properties, the symmetry
of the electronic wavefunctions and of the phonon modes. The proper interpretation
of these symmetry information requires the knowledge of the conventions on the 
underlying point groups. This small guide illustrates these conventions
for a better interpretation of the output of these codes. \\
For each point group we give: 
\begin{itemize}

\item
The crystal system and the Bravais lattices compatible with the point
group.

\item
The Laue class.

\item
A brief description of the symmetry operations. 
A description of the possible orientations of the rotation axes and of the 
mirror planes with respect to the Cartesian axes.

\item
The character table and a description of the main characteristic of each 
irreducible representation.

\item
The character table of the double group and a description of the main 
characteristic of each irreducible representation.

\item
A list of the possible subgroups and the relative orientation of the symmetry
elements of these subgroups.

\item
A subgroup compatibility table of the irreducible representations.

\item
A subgroup compatibility table of the double-group irreducible representations. 

\end{itemize}
It is assumed that the reader has a basic understanding of group theory and
of its use for the characterization of molecules and solids.
The mathematical theory behind these applications is described, 
at various levels of detail, in several books (see for instance the small 
bibliography at the end of this guide) and is not reported here. 
For the following discussion it is useful to read the Brillouin zone 
manual that you can find in the \texttt{Doc} sub-directory of the 
\qe\ distribution. For each Bravais lattice, the primitive lattice vectors
and their orientation with respect to the Cartesian axes, as given by the
\qe\ routines, are described there and here we assume that the reader has a
basic understanding of these primitive vectors.

\section{\color{coral}Overview}
The $32$ crystallographic point groups (point groups in the following)
in \qe\ and \tpw\ are identified by an integer number (the group code) and 
by a string (the group name) according to the following table:

\begin{verbatim}
 1  "C_1 (1)    ", 2  "C_i (-1)   ", 3  "C_s (m)    ", 4  "C_2  (2)   ", 
 5  "C_3 (3)    ", 6  "C_4 (4)    ", 7  "C_6 (6)    ", 8  "D_2  (222) ", 
 9  "D_3 (32)   ", 10 "D_4 (422)  ", 11 "D_6 (622)  ", 12 "C_2v (mm2) ", 
 13 "C_3v (3m)  ", 14 "C_4v (4mm) ", 15 "C_6v (6mm) ", 16 "C_2h (2/m) ", 
 17 "C_3h (-6)  ", 18 "C_4h (4/m) ", 19 "C_6h (6/m) ", 20 "D_2h (mmm) ", 
 21 "D_3h (-62m)", 22 "D_4h(4/mmm)", 23 "D_6h(6/mmm)", 24 "D_2d (-42m)", 
 25 "D_3d (-3m) ", 26 "S_4 (-4)   ", 27 "S_6 (-3)   ", 28 "T    (23)  ", 
 29 "T_h (m-3)  ", 30 "T_d (-43m) ", 31 "O   (432)  ", 32 "O_h (m-3m) "  
\end{verbatim}
All symmetry operations are conventionally divided in $6$ 
different types, with an integer number identifying the symmetry type:
\begin{verbatim}
   1 identity                          E
   2 inversion                         i
   3 proper rotation /= 180 degrees    C3, C4, or C6
   4 proper rotation of 180 degrees    C2
   5 mirror                            s
   6 improper rotation /= 180 degrees  S3, S4, or S6
\end{verbatim}
The point group is identified by counting the number of symmetry operations of 
each type. \\
The point group representations can be used to classify the symmetry properties 
of the electronic wavefunctions for wave-vectors inside the Brillouin zone. 
For wave-vectors on the Brillouin zone surface this is possible only for 
symmorphic space groups. For non-symmorphic space groups the symmetry classification
of the electronic wavefunctions with wave-vectors on the Brillouin zone surface
requires the representations of different groups that are not implemented 
in the \qe\ and \tpw\ codes and will not be discussed here.
The point groups have up to $12$ irreducible 
representations distinguished in the electronic bands or phonon dispersions
plots produced by \tpw\ by a different color. \\
The color codes for each representation are the following:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=16cm]{color.png} 
\end{center}
\begin{verbatim}
    1 -> red            2 -> green        3 -> blue           4 -> cyan
    5 -> magenta        6 -> gold         7 -> pink           8 -> black
    9 -> olive         10 -> brown       11 -> light-blue    12 -> orange
\end{verbatim} 
The number of each irreducible representation corresponds to its position
in the character table and is given below after the list of characters. 
The names of the irreducible representations have been taken from Ref.~[1]
for the point groups and from Ref.~[2] for the double point groups. The character
tables of the $32$ point groups can be found in many places but the 
conventions and definitions can be slightly different. So we
include the tables in this guide as a reference even if there is some 
overlap with Ref.~[2]. The tables are those printed by the \qe\ 
routines. For each character only two digits are given, so the
following correspondence should be used:
$1.41 \rightarrow \sqrt{2}$, $1.73 \rightarrow \sqrt{3}$, 
$0.71 \rightarrow \sqrt{2}/2$, $0.87 \rightarrow \sqrt{3}/2$.

The names of the symmetry operations are indicated using
the Schoenflies notation. 
We assume that the orientation of the axes is with the tip in the positive
$z$ hemisphere and positive rotation angles are counterclockwise about 
the rotation axis. Axes in the $z=0$ plane are oriented with the tip in the
positive $y$ direction, and the $x$ axis is oriented in the direction of positive
$x$. In this guide, improper rotations are described 
as rotations followed by inversion as in the Hermann-Mauguin (HM) 
definitions. In the Schoenflies notation improper rotations are rotations
followed by a mirror symmetry with respect to a plane perpendicular to 
the rotation axis.
So $S_6^5$ indicates a rotation of $+120^\circ$ degree about the axis 
followed by inversion (this operation is called $\bar 3$ in 
HM notation), $S_6$ a rotation of 
$-120^\circ$ followed by inversion ($\bar 3^5$), $S_3^5$ a rotation 
of $+60^\circ$ followed by inversion ($\bar 6$) and
$S_3$ a rotation of $-60^\circ$ followed by inversion ($\bar 6^5$).
$S_4^3$ is a rotation of $+90^\circ$ followed by inversion ($\bar 4$) and
$S_4$ is a rotation of $-90^\circ$ followed by inversion ($\bar 4^3$).
For the double groups a minus sign in front of the symmetry name
indicates that the operation is multiplied by the $360^\circ$ rotation 
(called \texttt{-E} in the tables or $\bar E$ in the text).

$B_1$ is even with respect to the mirror $\sigma_v$ and odd with respect to
the mirror $\sigma_v'$, while $B_2$ is odd with respect to $\sigma_v$ and even 
with respect to $\sigma_v'$. In order to fully characterize $B_1$ and $B_2$
it is important to make a definite choice for the planes $\sigma_v$ and $\sigma_v'$.
We use the definition in the previous table. Therefore even or odd is with respect

an axis ($C_3$ and $C_3^2$) and three mirror planes ($3\sigma_v$)

It is a group compatible with the trigonal and hexagonal systems and with the

Its Laue class is $D_{3d}$. \\
The $C_3$ axis can be: $z$, $x=y=z$, $x=-y=z$, $x=-y=-z$, $x=y=-z$.

the same axis ($C_2$), and six mirror symmetries with respect to
planes ($3\sigma_v$ and $3\sigma_d$) that contain the $C_6$ axis.
It is a group compatible with the hexagonal system and with the  
hexagonal (\texttt{ibrav=4}) Bravais lattice. \\ 
Its Laue class is $D_{6h}$. \\
The $C_6$ axis is the $z$ axis. The mirror planes $\sigma_v$ are perpendicular 
to $y$ and to $(y=\pm x/\sqrt{3}, z=0)$, while the mirror planes $\sigma_d$
are perpendicular to $x$ and to $(y=\pm \sqrt{3} x, z=0)$.
There is therefore $1$ realization of interest for solids. \\
The character table is (isomorphic to $D_6$ with $\sigma_v \rightarrow C_2'$
and $\sigma_d \rightarrow C_2''$):

There are six irreducible representations. $A_1$ is totally symmetric, while
$A_2$ is odd with respect to all mirror symmetries. $B_1$ and $B_2$ can be

respect to the planes $\sigma_v$ and even with respect to the planes 
$\sigma_d$. $E_1$ and $E_2$ are both two dimensional and can be 
distinguished by the character of a $C_6$ rotation. It is

There are three two-dimensional irreducible representations that can be 
distinguished for the character of the $C_6$ rotations, equal to $\sqrt{3}$
according to $\Gamma_7$, to $-\sqrt{3}$ according to $\Gamma_8$ and to
$0$ according to $\Gamma_9$.\\
The subgroups of $C_{6v}$ are $C_1$, $C_s$, $C_2$, $C_3$, $C_6$,
$C_{2v}$, and $C_{3v}$. The rotation axes of $C_2$, $C_3$, $C_6$, $C_{2v}$,
and $C_{3v}$ coincide with the rotation axis of $C_{6v}$. The mirror 
plane of $C_s$ can be a $\sigma_v$ (case 1) or a $\sigma_d$ (case 2). The two 
mirror planes of $C_{2v}$
can coincide with the two planes perpendicular to $x$ and $y$, 
or perpendicular to $(y=\sqrt{3} x, z=0)$ and $(y=-x /\sqrt{3}, z=0)$,
or perpendicular to $(y=-\sqrt{3} x, z=0)$ and $(y=x /\sqrt{3}, z=0)$.
In all three cases one of the two mirrors of $C_{2v}$ is a $\sigma_v$ of $C_{6v}$,
and the other is a $\sigma_d$ of $C_{6v}$. With our conventions on the choice of 
$\sigma_v$ and $\sigma_v'$ in $C_{2v}$, $\sigma_v$ of $C_{2v}$
coincides always with a plane $\sigma_v$ of $C_{6v}$ and $\sigma_v'$ with a 
plane $\sigma_d$.
The three mirror planes of $C_{3v}$ can coincide with the three mirrors 
$\sigma_v$ of $C_{6v}$ (case 1) or with the three mirrors $\sigma_d$ (case 2).\\

This group has four elements: The identity, a rotation of $180^\circ$ 
about an axis ($C_2$), inversion and a mirror symmetry with respect to 
a plane perpendicular to the $C_2$ axis.
It is a group compatible with the monoclinic system and with the  
simple monoclinic (\texttt{ibrav=$\pm$12}) and one-base centered monoclinic
(\texttt{ibrav=$\pm$13}) Bravais lattices. \\ 
Its Laue class is $C_{2h}$. \\
The axis can be:
$x$, $y$, $z$, $(x=y, z=0)$, $(x=-y, z=0)$, $(x=z, y=0)$, $(x=-z, y=0)$,

is perpendicular to the axis. There are therefore $13$ realizations 
of interest for solids. \\

\subsection{\color{web-blue}$C_{6h}\ (6/m)$}  
This group has twelve elements: The identity, two rotations of $\pm60^\circ$ 
about an axis ($C_6$ and $C_6^5$), two rotations of $\pm120^\circ$
about the same axis ($C_3$ and $C_3^2$), a rotation of $180^\circ$ about the
same axis ($C_2$), inversion, and the product of inversion with previous
rotations that gives two rotations of $\pm60^\circ$ multiplied by inversion
($S_3^5$ and $S_3$), two rotations of $\pm120^\circ$ multiplied 
by inversion ($S_6^5$ and $S_6$), and a mirror $\sigma_h$
with respect to a plane perpendicular to the $C_6$ axis. 
It is a group compatible with the hexagonal system and with the  
hexagonal (\texttt{ibrav=4}) Bravais lattice. \\ 
Its Laue class is $C_{6h}$. \\
The $C_6$ axis is parallel to the $z$ axis. There is therefore
$1$ realization of interest for solids. \\

\subsection{\color{web-blue}$D_{2h}\ (mmm)$ or $V_h$}  
This group has eight elements: The identity, three rotation of $180^\circ$
about three perpendicular axes ($C_2$, $C_2'$, and $C_2''$),
inversion and three mirror symmetries with respect to planes perpendicular to
the $C_2$, $C_2'$ and $C_2''$ axes ($\sigma_v$, $\sigma_v'$, and $\sigma_v''$).
It is a group compatible with the orthorhombic system and with the
simple orthorhombic (\texttt{ibrav=8}) and one-base centered 
orthorhombic (\texttt{ibrav=9}), face-centered orthorhombic (\texttt{ibrav=10}),
body-centered orthorhombic (\texttt{ibrav=11}) Bravais lattices. \\
Its Laue class is $D_{2h}$. \\
The three perpendicular axes can be:
\begin{itemize}
\item
a) $z$ ($C_2$), $y$ ($C_2'$), and $x$ ($C_2''$)
\item
b) $x$ ($C_2$), ($y=z$, $x=0$) ($C_2'$), ($y=-z$, $x=0$) ($C_2''$)
\item
c) $y$ ($C_2$), ($x=z$, $y=0$) ($C_2'$), ($x=-z$, $y=0$) ($C_2''$)
\item
d) $z$ ($C_2$), ($x=y$, $z=0$) ($C_2'$), ($x=-y$, $z=0$) ($C_2''$)
\item
e) $z$ ($C_2$), ($y=\sqrt{3}x$, $z=0$) ($C_2'$), ($y=-x/\sqrt{3}$, $z=0$) 
($C_2''$)
\item
f) $z$ ($C_2$), ($y=-\sqrt{3}x$, $z=0$) ($C_2'$), ($y=x/\sqrt{3}$, $z=0$) 
($C_2''$)
\end{itemize}
The mirrors $\sigma_v$, $\sigma_v'$, and $\sigma_v''$  are perpendicular to 
the $C_2$, $C_2'$, and $C_2''$ axes, respectively.
There are therefore $6$ realizations of interest in solids. \\
The character table is (using $D_{2h}=D_2 \times C_i$):

There are eight one-dimensional irreducible representations. $A_g$, $B_{1g}$,
$B_{2g}$, and $B_{3g}$ are even with respect to inversion while $A_u$, $B_{1u}$,
$B_{2u}$, and $B_{3u}$ are odd. $A$, $B_1$, $B_2$, and $B_3$ can be distinguished,
after deciding which axis is $C_2$, which axis is $C_2'$, and which axis
is $C_2''$, according to the symmetry with respect to these rotations.
$A$ is totally symmetric with respect to rotations, $B_1$ is even with
respect to $C_2$ and odd with respect to $C_2'$ and $C_2''$, 
$B_2$ is even with respect to $C_2'$ and odd with respect to $C_2$ and $C_2''$,
and $B_3$ is even with respect to $C_2''$ and odd with respect to
$C_2$ and $C_2'$.\\

There are two two-dimensional irreducible representations. $\Gamma_5^+$ is 
even with respect to inversion and $\Gamma_5^-$ is odd. \\
The subgroups of $D_{2h}$ are $C_1$, $C_i$, $C_s$, $C_2$, $D_2$, $C_{2v}$, and
$C_{2h}$. The axis of $C_2$ is parallel to one of
the axis of $D_{2h}$, $C_2$ (case 1), $C_2'$ (case 2), or $C_2''$ (case 3). 
The mirror of $C_s$ is one of the mirrors of $D_{2h}$,
so it can coincide with $\sigma_v$ (case 1), $\sigma_v'$ (case 2), or
$\sigma_v''$ (case 3). The axes of $D_2$ must be chosen in the same order
as those of $D_{2h}$. The axis of $C_{2v}$ can coincide with $C_2$
(cases 1,4), with $C_2'$ (case 2,5) or with $C_2''$ (case 3,6). The two mirrors
are those that contain the axis, so $\sigma_v'$ and $\sigma_v''$
in case 1,4, $\sigma_v$ and $\sigma_v''$ in case 2,5, and $\sigma_v$ and 
$\sigma_v'$ in case 3,6. The two mirrors must be assigned to $\sigma_v$ and
$\sigma_v'$ of $C_{2v}$ with the same conventions used to define the character 
table of $C_{2v}$. We have therefore $6$ cases summarized in the following table:
\begin{verbatim}
C_2v            C_2            s_v        s_v'     case
D_2h            C_2            s_v'       s_v''      1
D_2h            C_2            s_v''      s_v'       2
D_2h            C_2'           s_v        s_v''      3 
D_2h            C_2'           s_v''      s_v        4
D_2h            C_2''          s_v        s_v'       5
D_2h            C_2''          s_v'       s_v        6
\end{verbatim}
The axis of $C_{2h}$ is parallel to $C_2$ (case 1),
to $C_2'$ (case 2) or to $C_2''$ (case 3) and the mirror is perpendicular
to the axis, so it coincides with $\sigma_v$ in case 1, with $\sigma_v'$ in
case 2 and with $\sigma_v''$ in case 3. \\

\subsection{\color{web-blue}$D_{3h}\ (\bar 62m)$} 
This group has twelve elements: The identity, two rotations of $\pm120^\circ$
about an axis ($C_3$ and $C_3^2$), three rotations of $180^\circ$
about three axes ($3C_2$) perpendicular to the $C_3$ axis,
a mirror symmetry with respect to a plane perpendicular to the $C_3$ axis 
($\sigma_h$) and the product of this mirror symmetry with previous rotations
that gives two rotations of $\pm 60^\circ$ multiplied by inversion 
($S_3^5$ and $S_3$) about the $C_3$ axis and three mirror symmetries with respect 
to planes that contain the $C_3$ axis and one of the $3C_2$ axes
($3\sigma_v$). 
It is a group compatible with the hexagonal system 
and with the hexagonal (\texttt{ibrav=4}) Bravais lattice. \\
Its Laue class is $D_{6h}$. \\
The $C_3$ axis is $z$.
The three $C_2$ axes can be: $x$, ($y=\pm \sqrt{3} x$, $z=0$) (a), or
$y$, ($y=\pm x/\sqrt{3}$, $z=0$) (b). In case (a) the mirror planes 
$3\sigma_v$ are perpendicular to the $3C_2$ axes of case (b) and in case (b) 
they are perpendicular to the $3C_2$ axes of case (a).
There are therefore $2$ realizations of interest for solids. \\

There are six irreducible representations. $A_1'$, $A_2'$, and $E'$ are
even with respect to the mirror $\sigma_h$, while
$A_1''$, $A_2''$, and $E''$ are odd. The representations $E$ are
two dimensional. The one-dimensional representations $A_1$ and $A_2$ can
be distinguished because $A_1$ is even with respect to the $C_2$ rotations
while $A_2$ is odd. \\

\subsection{\color{web-blue}$D_{6h}\ (6/mmm)$} 
This group has twenty-four elements: The identity, two rotations of 
$\pm60^\circ$ about an axis ($C_6$ and $C_6^5$), two rotations of 
$\pm120^\circ$ about the same axis ($C_3$ and $C_3^2$), a rotation of 
$180^\circ$ about the same axis ($C_2$), six rotations of $180^\circ$ 
($3C_2'$ and $3C_2''$) about six axes perpendicular to the $C_6$ axis,
inversion, and the product of inversion with previous rotations that gives
two rotations of $\pm60^\circ$ about the
$C_6$ axis multiplied by inversion ($S_3^5$ and $S_3$), two rotations of 
$\pm120^\circ$ about the $C_6$ axis multiplied by inversion 
($S_6^5$ and $S_6$), a mirror plane 
perpendicular to the $C_6$ axis ($\sigma_h$), six mirrors perpendicular 
to $3C_2'$ and $3C_2''$ ($3\sigma_d$ and $3\sigma_v$).
It is a group compatible with the hexagonal system
and with the hexagonal (\texttt{ibrav=4}) Bravais lattice. \\
Its Laue class is $D_{6h}$. \\
The $C_6$ axis is the $z$ axis, the three $C_2'$ axes are 
$x$, $(y=\pm\sqrt{3}x, z=0)$, the three $C_2''$ axes
are $y$, $(y=\pm x/\sqrt{3}, z=0)$. The mirror planes
$\sigma_v$ are perpendicular to the $C_2''$ axes, while $\sigma_d$ are
perpendicular to the $C_2'$ axes. There is therefore $1$ realization
of interest for solids. \\
The character table is (using $D_{6h}=D_6 \times C_i$):

There are twelve irreducible representations. $A_{1g}$, $A_{2g}$, $B_{1g}$, 
$B_{2g}$, $E_{1g}$, and $E_{2g}$ are even with respect to inversion, while
$A_{1u}$, $A_{2u}$, $B_{1u}$, $B_{2u}$, $E_{1u}$, and $E_{2u}$ are odd.
The representations $E_1$ and $E_2$ are two dimensional and can be
distinguished because the character of the representation for the $C_2$ 
rotation about the $C_6$ axis is $-2$ according to $E_1$ and $2$ according
to $E_2$. The one-dimensional representations $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1$ and
$B_2$ have different behavior with respect to the two rotations $C_2'$ and
$C_2''$. $A_1$ is even with respect to both rotations, $A_2$ is odd with
respect to both rotations, $B_1$ is even with respect to $C_2'$ and odd with
respect to $C_2''$, while $B_2$ is odd with respect to $C_2'$ and even with
respect to $C_2''$. \\

There are six two-dimensional irreducible representations $\Gamma_7^+$,

$\Gamma_7$, $\Gamma_8$,
and $\Gamma_9$ can be distinguished for the character with respect to the $C_6$
rotations. It is $\sqrt{3}$ according to $\Gamma_7$, $-\sqrt{3}$ according
to $\Gamma_8$ and $0$ according to $\Gamma_9$.\\
The subgroups of $D_{6h}$ are $C_1$, $C_i$, $C_s$, $C_2$, $C_3$, $C_6$,

The mirror of $C_s$ can be chosen coinciding with $\sigma_h$ (case 1), 
with $\sigma_d$ (case 2), or with $\sigma_v$ (case 3). The $C_2$ axis of

Another possibility is that the axis of $C_{2v}$ coincides
with one of the $C_2'$ axes of $D_{6h}$. In this case the $\sigma_v$ mirror
of $C_{2v}$ can coincide with $\sigma_h$ of $D_{6h}$ and

$D_{6h}$ and the three mirrors of $C_{3v}$ can be perpendicular to $y$, 
$(y=\pm x/\sqrt{3}, z=0)$ (case 1), or to $x$ and $(y=\pm \sqrt{3} x, z=0)$

coincides with the $C_6$ axis of $D_{6h}$ and the $\sigma_h$ mirror plane
of $C_{3h}$ coincides with $\sigma_h$ of $D_{6h}$.
The $C_6$ axis of $C_{6h}$ coincides with the $C_6$ axis of $D_{6h}$ 
and the $\sigma_h$ mirror plane

\subsection{\color{web-blue}$D_{2d}\ (\bar 42m)$} 
This group has eight elements: The identity, two improper rotations 
of $\pm90^\circ$ about an axis ($S_4^3$ and $S_4$), a rotation of 
$180^\circ$ about the same axis ($C_2$), two rotations of $180^\circ$ about
two axes perpendicular to the $S_4$ axis ($2C_2'$) and two mirror symmetries
whose planes contain the $S_4$ axis ($2\sigma_d$).
It is a group compatible with the tetragonal system and with the simple 
tetragonal (\texttt{ibrav=6}) or the centered tetragonal (\texttt{ibrav=7}) 
Bravais lattices. \\
Its Laue class is $D_{4h}$. \\
The $S_4$ axis can be $x$, $y$, or $z$. There are several possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item a) $S_4$ axis parallel to $x$, $C_2'$ axes $y$ and $z$, $\sigma_d$
perpendicular to $(y=\pm z, x=0)$.
\item b) $S_4$ axis parallel to $x$, $C_2'$ axes $(y=\pm z, x=0)$, $\sigma_d$
perpendicular to $y$ and $z$.
\item c) $S_4$ axis parallel to $y$, $C_2'$ axes $x$ and $z$, $\sigma_d$
perpendicular to $(x=\pm z, y=0)$.
\item d) $S_4$ axis parallel to $y$, $C_2'$ axes $(x=\pm z, y=0)$, $\sigma_d$
perpendicular to $x$ and $z$.
\item e) $S_4$ axis parallel to $z$, $C_2'$ axes $x$ and $y$, $\sigma_d$
perpendicular to $(y=\pm x, z=0)$.
\item f) $S_4$ axis parallel to $z$, $C_2'$ axes $(y=\pm x, z=0)$, $\sigma_d$
perpendicular to $x$ and $y$.
\end{itemize}
There are therefore $8$ realizations of interest for solids.\\

There are two two-dimensional representations that can be distinguished
for the character for an $S_4$ rotation. The character is $\sqrt{2}$
according to $\Gamma_6$ and $-\sqrt{2}$ according to $\Gamma_7$. \\
The subgroups of $D_{2d}$ are $C_1$, $C_s$, $C_2$, $D_2$, $C_{2v}$, 
and $S_4$. The mirror of $C_s$ coincides with one of the mirror $\sigma_d$. 
The axis of $C_2$ can be the $S_4$ axis (case 1) or one of the 
$C_2'$ axes (case 2). The axes of $C_{2v}$ and $S_4$
coincide with the $S_4$ axis of $D_{2d}$. The mirrors of $C_{2v}$
coincide with the mirrors $\sigma_d$ of $D_{2d}$. For $D_2$ we have several 
possibilities: the axis $C_2$ of $D_2$ coincides with the axis $S_4$
of $D_{2d}$ and the other two axes of $D_2$ coincide with the $C_2'$ axes
of $D_{2d}$ (case 1), the axis $C_2'$ of $D_2$ coincides with the axis $S_4$
of $D_{2d}$ and the other two axes of $D_2$ coincide with the $C_2'$ axes

\subsection{\color{web-blue}$D_{3d}\ (\bar 3m)$} 
This group has twelve elements: The identity, two improper rotations 
of $\pm120^\circ$ about an axis ($S_6^5$ and $S_6$), two rotation of 
$\pm120^\circ$ about the same axis ($C_3$ and $C_3^2$), inversion,
three rotations of $180^\circ$ about three axes perpendicular to the 
$S_6$ axis ($3C_2'$) and three mirror symmetries whose planes contain 
the $S_6$ axis ($3\sigma_d$).
It is a group compatible with the trigonal or hexagonal systems and with the  
rhombohedral (\texttt{ibrav=5}) and hexagonal (\texttt{ibrav=4}) Bravais lattices. \\
Its Laue class is $D_{3d}$. \\
The six-fold rotoinversion axis can be: $z$, $x=y=z$, $x=-y=z$,
$x=-y=-z$, $x=y=-z$.
When the $S_6$ axis is $z$ the $C_2'$ axes can be:
$x$, $(y=\pm\sqrt{3}x, z=0)$ or $y$, $(y=\pm x/\sqrt{3}, z=0)$. The mirror
planes $\sigma_d$ are perpendicular to the $C_2'$ axes.
When the $S_6$ axis is $x=y=z$ the $C_2'$ axes are $(y=-z, x=0)$, 
$(x=-z, y=0)$, and $(y=-x, z=0)$. When the $S_6$ axis is $x=-y=z$ 
the $C_2'$ axes are $(y=z, x=0)$, $(x=-z, y=0)$, and $(y=x, z=0)$. 
When the $S_6$ axis is $x=-y=-z$ the $C_2'$ axes are $(y=-z, x=0)$, 
$(x=z, y=0)$, and $(y=x, z=0)$.  When the $S_6$ axis is $x=y=-z$ the 
$C_2'$ axes are $(y=z, x=0)$, $(x=z, y=0)$, and $(y=-x, z=0)$. The mirror
planes are perpendicular to the $C_2'$ axes.
There are therefore $6$ realizations of interest for solids. \\

This group has four elements: The identity, two improper rotations 
of $\pm90^\circ$ about an axis ($S_4$ and $S_4^3$),  
a rotations of $180^\circ$ about the same axis. 
It is a group compatible with the tetragonal system and with the  
simple tetragonal (\texttt{ibrav=6}) and centered tetragonal

This group has twenty-four elements: The identity, eight rotations 
of $\pm120^\circ$ about four axes ($8C_3$), three rotations of 
$180^\circ$ about three different axes ($3C_2$), six
improper rotations of $\pm90^\circ$ about the $C_2$ axes and
six mirror symmetries ($6\sigma_d$) with axes described below.
It is a group compatible with the cubic system and with the  
simple (\texttt{ibrav=1}), face-centered (\texttt{ibrav=2}), 
and body-centered cubic (\texttt{ibrav=3}) Bravais lattices. \\
Its Laue class is $O_{h}$. \\
The four axes $C_3$ are $x=y=z$, $x=-y=z$, $x=-y=-z$, $x=y=-z$, while

The six mirrors $\sigma_d$ are perpendicular to $(y=\pm z, x=0)$,
$(x=\pm z, y=0)$, $(y=\pm x, z=0)$.
There is therefore $1$ realization of interest for solids. \\

\subsection{\color{web-blue}$O_h\ (m\bar3m)$}   
This group has forty-eight elements: 
The identity, eight rotations of $\pm120^\circ$ about four axes ($8C_3$), 
three rotations of $180^\circ$ about three different axes ($3C_2$), six
rotations of $\pm90^\circ$ about the $C_2$ axes ($6C_4$), 
six rotations of $180^\circ$ ($6C_2'$) about axes described below, 
inversion, and the product of previous rotations with inversion that gives
eight rotation of $\pm60^\circ$ multiplied by inversion about the $C_3$ axes 
($8S_6$), three mirror planes $3\sigma_h$ perpendicular to the $C_4$ axes,
six rotations of $\pm90^\circ$ about the $C_4$ axes multiplied by inversion
($6S_4$), and six mirror planes perpendicular to the axes described
below ($6\sigma_d$). It is a group compatible with the cubic system and with the  
simple (\texttt{ibrav=1}), face-centered (\texttt{ibrav=2}), 
and body-centered cubic (\texttt{ibrav=3}) Bravais lattices. \\
Its Laue class is $O_{h}$. \\
The four axes $C_3$ are $x=y=z$, $x=-y=z$, $x=-y=-z$, $x=y=-z$, while
the three axes $C_4$ are $x$, $y$, $z$. 
The six $C_2'$ axes are $(y=\pm z, x=0)$, $(x=\pm z, y=0)$, $(y=\pm x, z=0)$.
The $\sigma_d$ planes are perpendicular to the $C_2'$ axes.
There is therefore $1$ realization of interest for solids. \\

There are six irreducible representations. $\Gamma_6^+$, $\Gamma_7^+$ and
$\Gamma_8^+$ are have positive characters for inversion, while
$\Gamma_6^-$, $\Gamma_7^-$ and $\Gamma_8^-$ have negative characters.
$\Gamma_8$ is four dimensional, while $\Gamma_6$ and $\Gamma_7$ can be
distinguished for the character of a $C_4$ rotation. $\Gamma_6$ has 
character $\sqrt{2}$, while $\Gamma_7$ has character $-\sqrt{2}.$ \\
The subgroups of $O_h$ are $C_1$, $C_i$, $C_s$, $C_2$, $C_3$, $C_4$,
$D_2$, $D_3$, $D_4$, $C_{2v}$, $C_{3v}$, $C_{4v}$, $C_{2h}$, $C_{4h}$, 
$D_{2h}$, $D_{4h}$, $D_{2d}$, $D_{3d}$, $S_4$, $S_6$, $T$, $T_h$, 
$T_d$, and $O$. The mirror of $C_s$ can coincide with one of the $\sigma_h$ 
mirrors (case 1) or with one of the $\sigma_d$ mirrors (case 2). The axis
of $C_2$ can coincide with one of the $C_4$ axis of $O_h$ (case 1) or
with one of the $C_2'$ axis (case 2). The axis of $C_3$ coincides with one
of the $C_3$ axes of $O_h$. The three axes of $D_2$ can coincide with the
$C_4$ axes of $O_h$ (case 1), or the $C_2$ axis of $D_2$ can coincide with one
of the $C_4$ axis of $O_h$ while the $C_2'$ and $C_2''$ coincide 
with the $C_2'$ axes of $O_h$ (case 2). The $C_3$ axis of $D_3$ coincides with
one of the four $C_3$ axes of $O_h$ and the three $C_2$ axes coincide with
the three $C_2'$ axes of $O_h$ perpendicular to the $C_3$ axis. The $C_4$
axis of $D_4$ coincides with one of the $C_4$ axes of $O_h$ and the
$C_2'$ axes coincide with the other two $C_4$ axes while the $C_2''$ axes
of $C_4$ coincide with the two $C_2'$ axes of $O_h$ perpendicular to the
$C_4$ axis of $D_4$. The $C_2$ axis of $C_{2v}$ can coincide with one of
the $C_4$ axes of $O_h$ and the two mirror planes can coincide with two
$\sigma_h$ planes (case 1) or with two $\sigma_d$ planes (case 2). The
$C_2$ axis of $C_{2v}$ can also coincide with one of the $C_2'$ axes
of $O_h$ and the two mirror planes are the $\sigma_h$ and the $\sigma_d$ 
that contain the axis (case 3).

and the mirror planes $\sigma_v$ of $C_{4v}$ coincide with the $\sigma_h$
planes of $O_h$ that contain the $C_4$ axis of $C_{4v}$, 
while the mirror planes $\sigma_d$ of $C_{4v}$ coincide
with the $\sigma_d$ planes of $O_h$ that contain the $C_4$ axis of $C_{4v}$.
The $C_2$ axis of $C_{2h}$ can be one of the $C_4$ axes of $O_h$ and
the $\sigma_h$ mirror coincides with the $\sigma_h$ mirror of $O_h$ 
perpendicular to the $C_2$ axis of $C_{2h}$ (case 1).
The other possibility is that the $C_2$ axis of $C_{2h}$ is one of 
the $C_2'$ axes of $O_h$ and the mirror $\sigma_h$ of $C_{2h}$ coincides with
the $\sigma_d$ mirror of $O_h$ perpendicular to the $C_2$ axis of $C_{2h}$
(case 2). The $C_4$ axis of $C_{4h}$ coincides with one of the
$C_4$ axes of $O_h$. The mirror perpendicular to the $C_4$ axis is one of
the $\sigma_h$ mirrors of $O_h$.

The $C_2'$ and the $C_2''$ axes of $D_{2h}$ can coincide with the other two 
$C_4$ axes of $O_h$ (case 1) or with the two $C_2'$ axes of $O_h$
perpendicular to the $C_2$ axis of $D_{2h}$ (case 2). The mirror planes of 
$D_{2h}$ are those 
perpendicular to these axes: the three $\sigma_h$ of $O_h$ in case 1 and a
$\sigma_h$ and two $\sigma_d$ of $O_h$ in case 2. $\sigma_v$ of $D_{2h}$
coincides with $\sigma_h$ of $O_h$ while $\sigma_v'$ and $\sigma_v''$
of $D_{2h}$ coincide with two $\sigma_d$ of $O_h$.
The $C_4$ axis of $D_{4h}$ is
one of the $C_4$ axis of $O_h$ and the two $C_2'$ axes of $D_{4h}$ coincide 
with the other two $C_4$ axes of $O_h$ while the two axes $C_2''$ of $D_{4h}$ 
coincide with the $C_2'$ axes of $O_h$ perpendicular to the $C_4$ axis of 
$D_{4h}$.
The mirror $\sigma_h$ of $D_{4h}$ coincides with the mirror $\sigma_h$ of
$O_h$ perpendicular to the $C_4$ axis of $D_{4h}$.
The $S_4$ axis of $D_{2d}$ coincides with one of the $C_4$ axis of $O_h$,
the $C_2'$ axes of $D_{2d}$ can coincide with the other $C_4$ axes of 
$O_h$ (case 1) or with the $C_2'$ axes of $O_h$ perpendicular to the $S_4$ 
axis of $D_{2d}$ (case 2). The two mirrors $\sigma_d$ of $D_{2d}$ are 
perpendicular to $C_2'$ axes of $D_{2d}$ of case 2 in case 1 and to the $C_2'$
axes of $D_{2d}$ of case 1 in case 2.
The $S_6$ axis of $D_{3d}$ coincides with one of the $C_3$ axes
of $O_h$, the three perpendicular axes $C_2'$ of $D_{3d}$ are the three axes 
$C_2'$ of $O_h$ perpendicular to the $S_6$ axis of $D_{3d}$. The mirror planes 
$\sigma_d$ of $D_{3d}$ are the $\sigma_d$ of $O_h$ perpendicular to the $C_2'$ 
axes of $D_{3d}$.
The $S_4$ axis of $S_4$ coincides with one of the $C_4$ axis of $O_h$. 
The $S_6$ axis of $S_6$ coincides with one of the $C_3$ axes of $O_h$. 
The $C_3$ and $C_2$ axes of $T$, $T_h$, $T_d$, and
$O$ coincide with those of $O_h$, and the $S_4$ and $C_2'$ axes of $T_d$ and
the $C_4$ and $C_2'$ axes of $O$ coincide with those of $O_h$. \\
