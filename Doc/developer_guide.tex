{\color{dark-blue}\chapter{Introduction}}
\color{black}
This guide discusses the internal organization of \tpw. It is not necessary
to read it to use \tpw. It contains some technical information not 
appropriate for the user's guide that you might need to modify the code.
It assumes that you have read and understood the user's guide and that
you have already some familiarity with the input variables and 
the working modes of \tpw.

{\color{coral}\section{People}}
\color{black}
This guide has been written by Andrea Dal Corso (SISSA - Trieste). 

{\color{coral}\section{Overview}}
\color{black}
\tpw\ is logically divided into parts. In some parts the different
images run asynchronously doing different tasks and in some parts the
run is synchronous. Usually in these synchronous parts results are 
collected, the image division of the processors is not used, and when possible
the work is parallelized among all available processors. In some cases
only the processors of the root image make the work while the others remain
idle.
Presently \tpw\ has two asynchronous runs each one followed
by one or more synchronous parts. The parts that are activated in
each run depend on the input variable \texttt{what}. After reading the input,
and writing some summary, the code calls the routine 
\texttt{initialize\_thermo\_work} that sets all the
logical flags that control the global run and the first asynchronous
part. The first asynchronous part (A) makes \texttt{nwork} \texttt{pw.x} 
calculations in parallel in each image. 
Then the following synchronous part makes one or more of
the following calculations:
\begin{itemize}

\item
B) \texttt{lconv\_ke\_test=.TRUE.} writes and plots the total
energy as a function of the kinetic energy.

\item
C) \texttt{lconv\_nk\_test=.TRUE.} writes and plots the total energy
as a function of the {\bf k}-points set.

\item
D) \texttt{lev\_syn\_1=.TRUE.} makes a Murnaghan fit of the 
total energy/enthalpy as a function of the unit cell volume or 
a quadratic/quartic fit of the total energy / enthalpy as a function 
of the crystal parameters and determines the minimum energy geometry.

\item
E) \texttt{lpwscf\_syn\_1=.TRUE.} makes a self-consistent \texttt{pw.x} 
calculation.

\item
F) \texttt{lband\_syn\_1=.TRUE.} makes a non self-consistent \texttt{pw.x}
calculation to compute the band structure.

\item
H0) \texttt{lectqha=.TRUE.} computes the elastic constants at $T=0$
as second derivatives of the energy or from the stress strain relationship. 

\end{itemize}

The second part can have an asynchronous part in which
many \texttt{pw.x} calculations are made (\texttt{lpart2\_pw=.TRUE.}) (G1)
or a loop of asynchronous phonon runs (G2), one for each geometry calculated
in A or at the minimum energy/enthalpy geometry
found in D whose self-consistent calculation has been done in E.
The G2 run is controlled by \texttt{lph=.TRUE.}, by \texttt{tot\_ngeo} which 
is the number of geometries, and by the flag 
\texttt{all\_geometries\_together}. When the latter is .FALSE.,
for each geometry the code calculates the phonon dispersions, the phonon 
dos and the 
harmonic thermodynamic quantities. The geometry to do is controlled only 
changing the \texttt{outdir} directory where the phonon run finds the
files produced by the \texttt{pw.x} calculation. The final collection
of the dynamical matrices, calculations of the phonon dispersions, phonon 
dos and harmonic thermodynamic quantities are done in a synchronous way 
within the loop over the geometries.
When \texttt{all\_geometries\_} \texttt{together=.TRUE.} a single asynchronous run
calculates all the irreducible representations of all geometries. After
the phonon run, the phonon dispersions, phonon dos and harmonic 
thermodynamic quantities are calculated synchronously in a loop over 
the geometries.

Following G1 or G2 there is another synchronous part. 
After G1 the synchronous part will do one of the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item
H1) \texttt{lel\_free\_energy=.TRUE.} computes the electronic dos and
the electronic thermodynamic properties. In this case G1 must have
computed the electronic bands for each geometry calculated in the first part.

\item
H) \texttt{lelastic\_const=.TRUE.} elastic constants calculations.

\item
I) \texttt{lpiezoelectric\_tensor=.TRUE.} piezoelectric tensor calculation.

\item
L) \texttt{lpolarization=.TRUE.} polarization calculation.

\end{itemize}

After G2, depending on \texttt{what} the synchronous part will do nothing, 
or if the phonons have been computed for several geometries and
\texttt{l\_ev\_syn2=.TRUE.} it will do:

\begin{itemize}

\item
M) the interpolation and minimization of the 
Helmholtz or Gibbs free energy at any temperature.

\item
N) Calculation of the Gr\"uneisen parameters on a path over the Brillouin
zone and their plot.

\item
O) Calculation of the anharmonic quantities such as the thermal expansion
from the numerical differentiation of the crystal parameters. 
Calculation of the temperature dependent elastic constants within 
the `quasi-static' or the `quasi-harmonic' approximation when enough 
information is available. Calculation of the isoentropic quantities when 
enough information is available. 

\item
P) Calculation of the Gr\"uneisen parameters on a uniform mesh of {\bf q} 
points and calculation of the thermal expansion from the Gr\"uneisen parameters.
Calculation of the isoentropic quantities when available.
\end{itemize}

Instead if \texttt{lectqha=.TRUE.} the code will do:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Q) Calculation of the temperature dependent elastic constants within the
`fixed-geometry quasi-harmonic' approximation.

\item
R) Calculation of the temperature dependent elastic constants within the
`quasi-harmonic' approximation.


\end{itemize}
There are also two initial routines (\texttt{thermo\_setup} and 
\texttt{thermo\_summary}) that can carry out preprocessing tasks, such as 
finding the space group or suggesting alternative \texttt{ibrav} and 
\texttt{celldm}. The two routines are called by all \texttt{what} options.
The first is used to initialize variables and the second to write messages 
on output.

{\color{dark-blue}\chapter{Scripts and Files}}
\color{black}

In almost all tasks, \tpw\ produces some data files containing the quantity 
to plot, some scripts to plot the data and, if the \texttt{gnuplot} code
is available, the postscript files with the plot of the data. So for each 
task there is an associated routine
that writes the output data and a routine that plots the output data
writing the \texttt{gnuplot} script. Usually the name of the routine that
writes the data starts with \texttt{write\_} and the routine that plots
the data is called \texttt{plot\_}. The following is a list of the routines
that write and plot the data and the name of the associated files
containing the data, the scripts and the postscript files.

{\color{dark-blue}\chapter{Directory structure}}
\color{black}
\tpw\ creates several directories where it saves the data needed to
create the plots or the information needed to restart the calculation.  
As \qe, it uses two main directories: the \texttt{working} 
directory, which is the current directory when \tpw\ is started 
(the one written by the unix command \texttt{pwd}), and a scratch directory 
called \texttt{outdir} directory and defined in the \texttt{pw.x} input. For its
internal purposes \tpw\ might change the \texttt{outdir} directory creating
some subdirectories within the \texttt{outdir} directory. This is done to
have different images working in different scratch directories and running
independently. \\
The following directories are created within the \texttt{working} directory:
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
restart         : a directory where each task creates a file with the total
                  energy and possibly the stress that it has calculated.

gnuplot_files   : a directory where the gnuplot scripts are written.

energy_files    : a directory where the energies for the energy minimization
                  or the Murnaghan interpolation are saved.

band_files      : a directory where the files with the energy bands and 
                  representations are written. This directory contains also
                  the files readable by the gnuplot code.

dynamical_matrices : a directory where the dynamical matrix files are
                  written.

phdisp_files    : a directory where the files with the phonon frequencies
                  and representations are written. This directory contains
                  also the files readable by the gnuplot code. Moreover it
                  contains the files with the interatomic force constants and
                  the dynamical matrices eigenvectors.

therm_files     : a directory where the files with the harmonic thermodynamic
                  properties are saved.

anhar_files     : a directory that contains the files with the anharmonic
                  quantities. This directory contains also the file with the
                  Gruneisen parameters and the files with the Gruneisen
                  parameters readable by the gnuplot code, together with the 
                  interpolated frequencies and the files with these frequencies
                  readable by the gnuplot code.
                  The 'quasi-static', 'fixed geometry quasi-harmonic' and
                  'quasi-harmonic' elastic constants are saved here.

elastic_constants : a directory that contains the elastic constants files
                    at T=0.
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}
The postscript files with the physical quantities are all written in
the \texttt{working} directory. \\
In the \texttt{outdir} directory defined in the input of \texttt{pw.x},
\tpw\ creates a directory called \texttt{g\#} for each geometry, 
where \texttt{\#} indicates the geometry number, and uses the directory 
\texttt{outdir/g\#} as the outdir directory for each different geometry. 
An image that receives the task, for instance a self-consistent calculation 
or a phonon calculation for a given geometry, will write in the directory 
corresponding to its geometry.
Moreover the phonon code will create a directory \texttt{\_ph\#} 
(where \texttt{\#} is the image number) within its \texttt{outdir/g\#} scratch 
directory, so that several images might work on the same geometry 
simultaneously.
Note that the number of geometries used in the first or in the second
asynchronous run coincide for some values of \texttt{what} and are
different for other values. \\
\texttt{What}s that do not require different geometries but might be carried
out asynchronously by different images, such as \texttt{what='scf\_ke'}, 
create an \texttt{outdir} directory called
\texttt{outdir/ke\#} for each different task, where \texttt{\#} is the
task number. Similarly, \texttt{what='scf\_nk'} uses outdir directories
called \texttt{outdir/nk\#}.
Recent versions of the \qe\ package allows also two different scratch
directories, one for the wavefunctions and one for the other quantities.
\tpw\ does not use this feature and sets always the wavefunction
directory coincident with the \texttt{outdir} directory.

\newpage
{\color{dark-blue}\chapter{The drivers}}
\color{black}

The \texttt{thermo\_pw} main program is in the file \texttt{src/thermo\_pw.f90}.
This routine is responsible for the main flow of the program discussed
in the previous sections. However in order to reduce the amount of
software that it contains, separate drivers, called 
\texttt{manage\_...},  coordinate more limited tasks.
Presently, the following drivers are available:
\begin{verbatim}
manage_sync_pw.f90 manage_syn_1.f90 manage_syn_2.f90
\end{verbatim}
coordinate the calculation of a synchronous \texttt{pw.x} run possibly 
followed by a non self consistent calculation, manage the calculation of 
the first and second synchronous parts,
\begin{verbatim}
manage_bands.f90, manage_surface_states.f90,      
\end{verbatim}
coordinate the calculation of the band structure, the electronic density
of states, and the identification of surface states,
\begin{verbatim}
manage_energy_minimum.f90      
\end{verbatim}
coordinates the fit of the energy with respect to the crystal parameters
or the Murnaghan fit,
\begin{verbatim}
manage_xrdp.f90,                
\end{verbatim}
coordinates the calculation of the X-ray power diffraction spectra,
\begin{verbatim}
manage_ph.f90, manage_ph_all_geometries.f90, manage_ph_postproc.f90,
manage_ph_run.f90      
\end{verbatim}
coordinate the calculation of the optical properties, the phonon dispersion
and the harmonic thermodynamic quantities at one or more geometries,
\begin{verbatim}
manage_collection.f90
\end{verbatim}
coordinates the collection of all the phonon calculations made by the 
different images
\begin{verbatim}
manage_ph_symmetry.f90
\end{verbatim}
coordinates the symmetry analysis of the phonon modes,
\begin{verbatim}
manage_elastic_cons.f90        
\end{verbatim}
coordinates the calculation of the elastic constants, the sound velocities,
the Debye temperature and the harmonic thermodynamic properties within the 
Debye approximation,
\begin{verbatim}
manage_anhar_routines.f90 manage_anhar.f90               
\end{verbatim}
coordinates the calculation of the anharmonic thermodynamic quantities,
\begin{verbatim}
manage_elastic_cons_qha.f90, manage_elastic_cons_qha_2.f90        
\end{verbatim}
coordinates the calculation of the temperature dependent elastic constants,
\begin{verbatim}
manage_el_free_energy.f90      
\end{verbatim}
coordinates the calculation of the electronic thermodynamic properties for
many geometries.

Presently the managers are called in the sequence:
\begin{verbatim}
a.r.  (part 1)
               -> manage_energy_minimum -> manage_xrdp
manage_syn_1   -> manage_elastic_cons

               -> manage_bands -> manage_surface_states
manage_sync_pw -> manage_xrdp

a.r.  (part 2)
               -> manage_el_free_energy
manage_syn_2   -> manage_elastic_cons

                                           -> manage_collection
               -> manage_ph_all_geometries (a.r. part 2) 
                                           -> manage_ph_postproc
manage_ph_run  -> manage_ph (a.r. part 2) -> manage_collection
                                          -> manage_ph_postproc

                      -> manage_anhar
manage_anhar_routines -> manage_anhar_anis

manage_elastic_cons_qha -> manage_elastic_cons_qha_2

a.r. means asynchronous run.

{\color{dark-blue}\chapter{How to insert a new flow-chart}}
\color{black}
In order to insert a new flow-chart in the \texttt{thermo\_pw} code it
is necessary to set a new option for the variable \texttt{what}. The
new option will control what happens in the following routines:
\begin{verbatim}
thermo_setup.f90, thermo_summary.f90, initialize_thermo_work.f90, 
set_thermo_work_todo.f90
\end{verbatim}
and the software that controls the option must be added to these routines.
In addition new variables needed to control the option can be added
in 
\begin{verbatim}
thermo_mod.f90, thermo_readin.f90, bcast_thermo_input.f90,
\end{verbatim}
while allocation and deallocation of global variables must be done
in 
\begin{verbatim}
allocate_thermo.f90, deallocate_thermo.f90.
\end{verbatim}
Auxiliary software to control the option can be written independently
from the main \texttt{thermo\_pw} variables in a separate
module in the library. Finally one might need a routine that makes the
postprocessing of the data computed for the new option and writes them on
file and a routine that plots these data. The former should be called 
\texttt{write\_...} while the latter will be \texttt{plot\_...}.
These can be called from a manager routine which is called where needed
in \texttt{thermo\_pw.f90}. \\
\texttt{thermo\_setup.f90} and \texttt{thermo\_summary.f90} are two routines 
that are called at the beginning of the run. The first
can save input variables or call preprocessing routines that work on 
the input variables of the option while the second summarizes the 
calculation to do. Here one can add some message to the output to 
illustrate what the new option will do. \\ 
\texttt{initialize\_thermo\_work.f90} will set for each options the
number of tasks to do in the first and second asynchronous runs and
for each run it sets the variables needed to construct the
input of \texttt{pw.x} or of \texttt{ph.x}. Moreover this routine creates
the directories where the output files will be written and sets the
logical flags that controls the flow of the code for a given option. \\
\texttt{set\_thermo\_work\_todo.f90} is instead a routine that receives
from the asynchronous driver the integer (\texttt{iwork}) that identifies
the task to do and using the variables set by
\texttt{initialize\_} \texttt{thermo\_work.f90} will set the input variables
of \texttt{pw.x} or of \texttt{ph.x} for that task. This is the only 
routine that should modify the internal variables of \qe. It is supposed
play the same role of the \texttt{input.f90} routine of \qe\  
which is called by \texttt{thermo\_pw} at the beginning of the run
but not before each task.

\newpage
{\color{dark-blue}\chapter{Files contents}}
\color{black}

Many data files produced by \texttt{thermo\_pw} are in a form readable
by the \texttt{gnuplot} program and are therefore arranged in columns.
Usually the first column is the temperature, the pressure, or the volume
and the other columns are
the physical quantities. Several other files are in a format exported
from the \qe\ package and are usually readable by its 
programs. In this section we report a short list of the files produced
by \texttt{thermo\_pw} and a short description of the quantities 
saved in each file. 

\begin{itemize}

\item 
\texttt{band\_files/filband(.rap)} (default name 
\texttt{output\_band.dat(.rap)}) contains the band eigenvalues for each 
{\bf k} point. The \texttt{.rap} file contains the number of the irreducible
representation for each band. The format of these files is a generalization
of the format used by the \texttt{plotband.f90} code of \qe. In addition
it contains gauges information for points at zone border in nonsymmorphic
space groups.

\item 
\texttt{band\_files/flpband(.\#)(.\#)} 
(default name \texttt{output\_pband.dat(.\#)(.\#)}).
These files contain the band eigenvalues along a line of the path 
(and for one irreducible representation). 
The format is readable by \texttt{gnuplot} and are similar to the files written
by the \texttt{plotband.f90} code of \qe. The numbers in
the filename indicate the number of the line along the path and the number 
of the irreducible representation.

\item 
\texttt{band\_files/info\_data} (default name \texttt{info\_data}). This
file contains the information needed by \texttt{thermo\_pw}
to redo the plot without reading the files produced by \texttt{pw.x}
when \texttt{only\_bands\_plot=.TRUE.}. It is written
in a form readable by \texttt{thermo\_pw}. Among other things it
contains the Fermi level.

\item 
\texttt{energy\_files/flevdat} (default name \texttt{output\_ev.dat}).
This file contains the total energy as a function of the volume for the
points actually calculated by \texttt{thermo\_pw}. It has the format
\begin{verbatim}
Omega     energy
\end{verbatim}
where $\Omega$ is the volume and energy is the total energy (or enthalpy at
finite pressure).

\item 
\texttt{energy\_files/flevdat(\_mur)} 
(default name \texttt{output\_ev.dat\_mur}).
This file contains the Murnaghan interpolation of the input data on a 
mesh of volumes and the pressure that corresponds to each volume. It has
the format:
\begin{verbatim}
# omega (a.u.)**3       energy (Ry)     enthalpy(p) (Ry)  pressure (kbar)
\end{verbatim}
where $\Omega$ is the volume, energy the total energy 
(or enthalpy as a function of volume at finite pressure) and 
enthalpy(p) is the enthalpy as a function of pressure. 

\item 
\texttt{energy\_files/flevdat(\_mur\_press)} 
(default name \texttt{output\_ev.dat\_mur\_press}).
This file contains the parameters of the equation of state 
computed as a function of pressure. It has the format: 
\begin{verbatim}
#  press (kbar)    v0 (a.u.)^3    b0 (kbar)    b01     b02 (1/kbar)
\end{verbatim}
where \texttt{v0}, \texttt{b0}, \texttt{b01}, and \texttt{b02} are the
volume, the bulk modulus, the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus,
and the second pressure derivative of the bulk modulus with respect to
pressure. \texttt{b02} is present only if the Birch-Murnaghan equation
of fourth order is chosen for interpolation.

\item 
\texttt{energy\_files/flevdat(.ev.out)} 
(default name \texttt{output\_ev.dat.ev.out}).
This file contains the output information on the energy interpolation 
in the same format as the output of the \texttt{ev.x} program of 
\qe\ package. This file is written in two formats.
There is also an \texttt{.xml} file where the same quantities are written 
with more digits and in the \texttt{XML} format.

\item 
\texttt{energy\_files/flenergy(\#)} 
(default name \texttt{output\_energy.dat(\#)}). This file is written only
when \texttt{lmurn=.FALSE.}. Its content depends on the crystal system.
For the cubic system it contains:
\begin{verbatim}
#   celldm(1)       energy
\end{verbatim}
For hexagonal and tetragonal systems it contains:
\begin{verbatim}
#   celldm(1)    celldm(3)   energy
\end{verbatim}
For trigonal systems it contains:
\begin{verbatim}
#   celldm(1)    celldm(4)   energy
\end{verbatim}
For orthorhombic system several of these files are produced, one for each
value of \texttt{celldm(3)} and they contain:
\begin{verbatim}
#   celldm(1)    celldm(2)   energy
\end{verbatim}
For all other systems a file is produced with the format:
\begin{verbatim}
#  celldm(1) celldm(2) celldm(3) celldm(4) celldm(5) 
   celldm(6) energy
\end{verbatim}

\item 
\texttt{therm\_files/fleldos} (default name \texttt{output\_eldos.dat}).
This file contains the electron density of states. It has the format
\begin{verbatim}
#  E (eV)   dos(E)     Int dos(E)
\end{verbatim}
and contains the energy, the electron density of states per cell, and
its integral. In the local spin density case the format of the file is
\begin{verbatim}
#  E (eV)   dosup(E)  dosdn(E)    Int dos(E)
\end{verbatim}
with the density of states for spin up and for spin down. The integrated
density of states refers to the sum of spin up and spin down states.

\item 
\texttt{therm\_files/fleltherm} (default name \texttt{output\_eltherm.dat}).
This file contains the electron thermodynamic properties as a function of
temperature. It has the format:
\begin{verbatim}
#   T  energy   free energy   entropy  C_v  chemical pot
\end{verbatim}
and contains the electron excitation energy, free energy, entropy, 
isochoric specific heat and chemical potential.

\item 
\texttt{phdisp\_files/flfrc.g\#} (default name \texttt{output\_frc.dat.g\#}).
For each geometry for which a phonon dispersion is calculated this file
contains the interatomic force constants. It is in a format readable by
the code \texttt{matdyn.f90} of the QE distribution. \texttt{g\#} indicates 
the number of the geometry.

\item 
\texttt{phdisp\_files/flvec.g\#} (default name 
\texttt{matdyn.modes.g\#}). For each geometry for which a phonon dispersion
is calculated this file contains the vibrational modes and the frequencies
along the path. It is in a format defined by the \texttt{matdyn.f90} routine 
of the QE distribution.

\item 
\texttt{phdisp\_files/flfrq.g\#} (default name \texttt{output\_frq.dat.g\#}).
For each geometry for which a phonon dispersion is calculated this file
contains the frequencies along the path. It is in a format which is a 
generalization of the file produced by the code \texttt{plotband.f90} of 
the QE distribution.

\item 
\texttt{phdisp\_files/flpband.g\#(.\#)(.\#)} 
(default name \texttt{output\_pband.dat.} \texttt{g\#(.\#)(.\#)}).
For each geometry for which a phonon dispersion is calculated these files
contain the frequencies along the path. They are in a format readable by
\texttt{gnuplot} as produced by the \texttt{plotband.f90} code of \qe.
The numbers after the geometry indicate the number of the line 
along the path and the number of the irreducible representation.

\item 
\texttt{phdisp\_files/fldosfrq.g\#} (default name

parallelization}}

The following scheme shows how a single loop composed of \texttt{nwork} tasks
can be parallelized with a master-slave approach.

{\color{dark-blue}\chapter{The directory qe}}
\color{black}

The directory \texttt{qe} contains several routines of \qe\ that need to
be modified or improved to be used in \texttt{thermo\_pw}. This
directory is used to add new functionalities to \qe. Note that this directory
does not link the \texttt{thermo\_pw} variables and cannot use them, while
\texttt{thermo\_pw} links the library produced in this directory and can
call these routines instead of those of \qe. The routines in this directory
can call all the routines or use the variables of all the libraries
of \qe: \texttt{pwlib}, \texttt{liblrmodule},
\texttt{phlib}, \texttt{pplib} and all lower level libraries.
As a rule the routines here should have the same names of those in \qe\ with
the extension \texttt{\_tpw}. This directory contains also many routines
of \qe\ that have no modification except the call to the \texttt{\_tpw}
routines. The additional global variables needed by these routines are
contained in the file \texttt{control\_qe.f90} and should be added there.

\newpage
{\color{dark-blue}\chapter{Make join\_qe and make leave\_qe}}
\color{black}

The command \texttt{make join\_qe} substitutes three files of the QE
distribution: \texttt{Makefile} in the main QE directory, 
\texttt{install/makedeps.sh} and \texttt{install/}
\texttt{plugins\_makefile}.
These files need to be modified to insert the commands needed to
compile \tpw. The original files of the QE distribution are copied
in the main \texttt{thermo\_pw} directory with the name extension
\texttt{\_qe}. The command \texttt{make leave\_qe} restores the original
files in the QE distribution.
Occasionally this technique is also used to substitute a few QE files
to correct bugs identified between the release of the QE package 
and the release of the \tpw\ package. In these cases it is important
to give the comman \texttt{make join\_qe} before compiling QE.
